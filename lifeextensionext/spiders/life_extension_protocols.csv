  <h2> What is Osteoarthritis?
  </h2>
<p>
    Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that typically affects
    weight-bearing joints and hands. This disease is caused by the loss of
    protective cartilage in joints. There is no cure for osteoarthritis, and
    treatments generally aim to reduce load (losing weight to remove stress
    from joints), improve joint support, and relieve pain.
</p>
<p>
    Pain relief often comes from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
    (NSAIDs); however, some people are not aware that excessive use of NSAIDs
    can cause liver and kidney damage. NSAIDs also cannot help with rebuilding
    damaged joint cartilage and are purely palliative.
</p>
<p>
    Natural interventions such as undenatured type-II collagen and
    methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) may help manage osteoarthritis causes and
    symptoms.

    <li>
        Joint-replacement surgery
    </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are Emerging Therapies for Osteoarthritis?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Tanezumab is an antibody against nerve growth factor (which plays a
    significant role in pain transmission) that can reduce pain intensity </li>
  <li>
    Stem cell treatment
  </li>
  <li>
    Hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women
  </li>
  <li> Apitherapy (treatment with bee venom, alone or in combination with
    acupuncture) </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Can Help Osteoarthritis?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Exercise, at least 30 minutes of walking 3 days per week </li>
</ul>
<h2> What Natural Interventions May Help Osteoarthritis?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Glucosamine</strong>. Glucosamine is a component of glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans,
    which help provide cartilage the flexibility it needs to function.
    Glucosamine has been shown to reduce the severity of osteoarthritis
    symptoms. </li>
  <li><strong>Chondroitin</strong>. This complex sugar molecule is found in connective tissue and
    contributes lubrication to cartilage. Chondroitin has been shown to
    reduce pain and increase joint function in patients with
    osteoarthritis. </li>
  <li><strong>Hyaluronic acid</strong>. Hyaluronic acid is a building block for cartilage. When administered
    orally or intra-articularly, hyaluronic acid has demonstrated pain
    relief and increased functionality in patients with osteoarthritis. </li>
  <li>
    Sulfur compounds such as <strong>methylsulfonylmethane (MSM)</strong>
    and <strong>keratin</strong>. These compounds can reduce pain and
    inhibit the degenerative quality of osteoarthritis. Both MSM and
    keratin treatments have been shown to relieve pain and improve joint
    functionality.
  </li>
  <li><strong>S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe)</strong>. SAMe may stimulate the production of cartilage, leading to reduced
    pain and stiffness in patients with osteoarthritis. </li>
  <li><strong>Proteolytic enzymes</strong>. Various proteolytic enzymes, including <strong>bromelain</strong>,
    have been shown to reduce pain and increase functionality in
    osteoarthritis. A supplement containing bromelain was more effective
    than the NSAID diclofenac in a clinical trial.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Undenatured type-II collagen</strong>. The gradual destruction of joint cartilage exposes collagen, causing
    an immune response and inflammatory attack on the joint. Treatment with
    undenatured collagen may help reduce this inflammation and induce
    tolerance, leading to enhanced daily activities in patients with
    osteoarthritis. </li>
  <li>Other anti-inflammatory options are <strong>soy </strong>and<strong> avocado oil</strong>, <strong>omega-3 fatty acids</strong>,<strong> curcumin</strong>,<strong> ginger</strong>,<strong> Korean angelica</strong>,<strong> vitamin D</strong>,    <strong> </strong>and <strong>green tea</strong>, among others.<em></em>

  <h2> What are Arrhythmias?
  </h2>
<p>
    Arrhythmias are irregularities in heart rate or rhythm. They are caused
    when the electrical signaling in the heart is disrupted. Arrhythmias often
    occur in people with underlying heart disease; however, even healthy hearts
    can experience an abnormal rate or rhythm. Some arrhythmias are
    life-threatening, while others are not directly life-threatening, but can
    increase the likelihood of a stroke.
</p>
<p>
    “Arrhythmia” is a term that encompasses all kinds of irregularities; they
    can be classified by whether they slow or speed the heart rate, and which
    area of the heart is affected. There are many kinds of arrhythmias and they
    can each require different treatments.
</p>
<p>
Natural interventions such as <strong>magnesium</strong> and    <strong>coenzyme Q10</strong> may support heart health and reduce the risk
    of arrhythmias.
</p>
<h2> What are the Risk Factors for Arrhythmias?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Underlying heart conditions, including:
  </li>

  </li>
  <li> Using stimulants (eg, coffee, certain medications, and drugs like
    methamphetamine) </li>
  <li> Participating in performance sports (ie, athletes) </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are the Signs and Symptoms of Arrhythmias?
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: Many people with arrhythmias do not experience any symptoms. For those
    who do, symptoms may include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Racing or pounding heart
    </li>
    <li>
        Chest pain
    </li>
    <li>
        Shortness of breath
    </li>
    <li>
        Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting
    </li>
    <li>
        Anxiety
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduced capacity for exercise
    </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are Conventional Medical Treatments for Arrhythmias?
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: Treatment options will vary depending on the type of arrhythmia. A doctor
    experienced in managing arrhythmias can determine the best course of
    treatment. </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Vagal maneuvers
  </li>
  <li> Medications such as sodium-, potassium-, or calcium channel blockers </li>
  <li>
    Defibrillation
  </li>
  <li>
    Ablation therapy
  </li>
  <li>
    Implantable devices such as pacemakers
  </li>
  <li> Surgery (for serious cases that do not respond to other treatments) </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Can be Beneficial for Arrhythmias?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Follow a heart-healthy diet (eg, Mediterranean diet) </li>
  <li>
    Exercise
  </li>
  <li>
    Maintain a healthy body weight
  </li>
  <li>
    Quit smoking
  </li>
  <li>
    Reduce alcohol and caffeine intake
  </li>
  <li>
    Reduce stress
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What Natural Interventions Can be Beneficial for Arrhythmias?
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Omega-3 fatty acids</strong>. Higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids are associated with lower risk
        of certain arrhythmias. They offer other cardioprotective benefits as
      well. </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Magnesium</strong>. Magnesium is essential for proper heart function. Symptoms of
        different arrhythmias can be improved with oral magnesium
      administration. </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Potassium</strong>. Alterations in serum potassium levels can contribute to the
        development of arrhythmias. Treatment with intravenous magnesium and
      potassium may restore normal heart rhythm. </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Hawthorn</strong>. Hawthorn may play a supportive role in cardiovascular health due to
        several mechanisms, including modulating ion channels. A clinical trial
        demonstrated hawthorn’s ability to improve heart function and reduce
      related symptoms. </li>
    <li>
        <strong>N-acetylcysteine</strong>. N-acetylcysteine is an antioxidant that may reduce the incidence of
      post-operative atrial fibrillation (a type of arrhythmia). </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)</strong>. CoQ10 has been shown to exert therapeutic effects in various cardiac
        conditions. In patients who had heart attacks, CoQ10 supplementation
      lowered the occurrence of arrhythmias and improved antioxidant levels. </li>
    <li>
Other natural interventions include <strong>vitamins C and E</strong>,        <strong>rhodiola</strong>, and <strong>resveratrol</strong>.

"<div><a id=""introduction"" name=""introduction""></a><p>Millions of women, at  some point in their lives, experience troublesome physical, emotional, and  cognitive symptoms during the two weeks leading up to menstruation (Bhatia 2002; MGH 2013). When these symptoms  interfere with day-to-day life, this is called <em>premenstrual syndrome</em> or <em>PMS</em> (Marjoribanks 2013; O'Brien 2011; Rapkin 2012; Alvero  2014). It is estimated that <span style=""white-space: nowrap"">8–20%</span> of reproductive-aged women experience  moderate-to-severe PMS (Rapkin 2009). </p><p>
    <em>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder</em> or <em>PMDD</em> is a premenstrual condition closely related to PMS that affects an estimated  3–8% of women (Rees 2014; Marjoribanks 2013;  Steiner 2006). PMDD is usually characterized by severe psychological  symptoms such as depression, anxiety, or persistent anger. PMDD is much more  severe than PMS and can impact a woman’s life as much as major depressive  disorder (Pearlstein 2008; Rapkin 2009; Epperson  2012). </p><p>
Both PMS and PMDD occur  in cycles. During the <strong>luteal phase</strong> of the <em>menstrual cycle</em>, which lasts  from ovulation to the onset of menstruation, levels of the hormones <strong>estrogen</strong> and <strong>progesterone</strong> in a woman’s body change (Justice 1999; Ounis-Skali 2006). These hormonal fluctuations  coincide with the onset of PMS symptoms. It is thought that changing hormone  levels affect brain chemicals called neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, which  help regulate mood (Freeman 2002). Direct  actions of hormones, coupled with their effects on neurotransmitters, are  believed to contribute to PMS and PMDD. The symptoms of PMS and PMDD usually go  away when, or soon after, menstruation begins and return again during the next  luteal phase (Rapkin 2012; Rees 2014; Rapkin  2014). </p><p>
Dietary and lifestyle  changes may be sufficient to resolve symptoms in mild cases of PMS. These  include exercising; eating a healthy diet rich in vegetables, whole grains, and  fruits; avoiding excess salt, sugar, alcohol, and caffeine; getting adequate  sleep; managing stress; and not smoking. Over-the-counter pain relievers can  help address physical symptoms such as cramps, pain, and headaches, but are not  without side effects, especially if used long-term (OWH 2012; Alvero 2014). Cognitive behavioral therapy and other  behavioral and self-help modalities may also reduce PMS and PMDD symptoms (Pearlstein 2008; Willacy 2012). </p><p>
For women whose  symptoms are not relieved by dietary and lifestyle modifications alone, several  drugs are available to treat PMS and PMDD, though many women find several of them  to be only partially effective or experience unwanted side effects (Kleinstauber 2012; Rapkin 2009; Marjoribanks 2013).  These medications include oral contraceptives and gonadotropin-releasing  hormone agonists, which block ovulation; and serotonin reuptake inhibitors and  anxiolytics, which modify brain neurochemical metabolism (Mayo Clinic 2012).   </p><p>
Women who suffer from  PMS or PMDD are not limited to conventional treatments, however. Many  integrative interventions, including calcium and vitamin D, chasteberry  extract, magnesium, St. John’s wort, and vitamin B6 have been shown  to reduce symptoms of PMS in clinical studies (Bertone-Johnson 2005; Canning 2010; Yonkers 2008; Alvero 2014; OWH 2012).  Moreover, given the hormonal basis of PMS and PMDD symptoms, women who  experience either of these conditions should undergo a blood test to evaluate  their sex hormone levels. Hormonal imbalance, which can be revealed by blood  testing, may be an important underlying factor in PMS and PMDD for some women.  Once a hormonal imbalance has been identified, some women may benefit from  using <strong><em>bioidentical hormone replacement therapy</em></strong> to restore balance  among their hormones (Dennerstein 1985;  Fugh-Berman 2007; Holtorf 2009; Hudson 2013).</p><p>
In this protocol you  will learn about the possible causes of PMS and PMDD, and how to differentiate  these two conditions. You will also learn how PMS and PMDD are typically  treated and common side effects of conventional treatments. Emerging treatment  modalities will be examined and a number of integrative interventions that may  help relieve symptoms of PMS and PMDD will be described.</p>

"<div><a name=""introduction"" id=""introduction""></a>
<p><strong><em>Celiac  disease</em></strong> is an inflammatory  immune disorder that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals. In people  with celiac disease, ingestion of <strong>gluten</strong>—the  protein fraction of <em>wheat</em>, <em>barley</em>, and <em>rye</em>—provokes an immune attack that inflames and damages the lining  of the small intestine. This typically results in nutrient malabsorption along  with a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from diarrhea and constipation to skin  rashes and depression (Brown 2012; Korponay-Szabo  2012; Lerner 2014; A.D.A.M. 2014). The reaction to gluten triggered by  celiac disease is not an allergy, but rather an insidious inflammatory immune  condition (FARE 2015a).</p>
<p>Untreated  celiac disease can lead to the development of a host of other conditions  including osteoporosis, infertility, neurological disorders, other autoimmune  diseases, and in some cases, cancer (Ventura 1999; Fasano, Catassi 2012;  Rashtak 2012; Kagnoff 2007; Sapone 2012; Bai 2013; UCMC 2014).</p>
<p>The  prevalence of celiac disease has been rising sharply in recent decades. The  reasons for the increase are not fully understood, but are thought to be due in  part to better detection and diagnosis rates, as well as an actual increase in  incidence, which may be a result of increasing dietary gluten content or  changes in infant feeding patterns, among other possibilities (Sapone 2012). At least three million  Americans, or approximately 1% of the US population, have celiac disease,  making it more than four times as common today than just 30 years ago (Lundin  2012; Rubio-Tapia 2009; Lohi 2007).</p>
<p>Celiac  disease is largely a hidden epidemic, since it is estimated that an alarming 85–90%  of individuals in the United States who have celiac disease remain undiagnosed (Ferri 2015). In the United States, it takes an  average of four years for a symptomatic person with celiac disease to be  diagnosed, a delay that markedly increases the risk of developing autoimmune  disorders, neurological problems, osteoporosis, and cancer (UCMC 2014).</p>
<p>
  In  addition, emerging evidence suggests the existence of a clinically distinct sensitivity  reaction to gluten-containing grains. This more recently characterized disorder  has been referred to as both <em>non-celiac  wheat sensitivity </em>and <em>non-celiac  gluten sensitivity </em>(Carroccio 2012;  Marchioni Beery 2015).<strong></strong> This condition was described in the  1980s, and evidence for the existence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity has  grown in recent years.<strong></strong> Estimates suggest non-celiac gluten  sensitivity is six times as common as celiac disease (Jackson 2012; Catassi 2013; Lundin 2012; Czaja-Bulsa 2014; Sapone  2012). Some recent research indicates that it may not be gluten or other  proteins that cause people without celiac disease to react to these foods, but  rather difficult-to-digest carbohydrates called FODMAPs (Biesiekierski 2013).</p>
<p>People  with non-celiac gluten sensitivity can experience a spectrum of symptoms  similar to those caused by celiac disease, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea,  joint pain, and depression. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity does not appear to be  an autoimmune condition, making it distinct from celiac disease; neither is non-celiac  gluten sensitivity an allergic condition, which distinguishes it from classical  wheat allergy (Sapone 2012). In fact,  there are currently no universally recognized laboratory tests or biomarkers  for non-celiac gluten sensitivity; the condition can be diagnosed by a  double-blind challenge with gluten-containing food (Jackson 2012; Catassi 2013; Lundin 2012). </p><p>
  Currently, the only recognized treatment  for celiac disease is strict, lifelong adherence to a <strong><em>gluten-free diet</em></strong>. This  means avoiding all foods containing wheat, rye, barley, and their derivatives,  as well as gluten-containing non-foods such as medicines and supplements.  People with celiac disease must also be careful when selecting foods such as  oats that may be contaminated with gluten-containing grains (Bai 2013; Sapone  2012; Fasano, Catassi 2012). </p><p>
  However, the gluten-free diet is  nutritionally inadequate in some cases, whether as a result of poor food  choices or inherent deficiencies in the diet due to lack of nutritional  fortification of gluten-free foods (Shepherd  2013). While the gluten-free diet is also used to treat non-celiac  gluten sensitivity, the need for strict adherence or permanency is not clear  (Sapone 2012).</p>
<p>This  protocol will give you a better understanding of celiac disease and non-celiac  gluten sensitivity, and how they differ. The gluten-free diet will be reviewed  and new treatment frontiers will be discussed. You will also learn about  lifestyle changes and targeted nutritional support with several natural  compounds that can complement the gluten-free diet by correcting nutritional  deficiencies, promoting intestinal healing, balancing the immune system, and  reducing chronic inflammation.</p>

<div class=""wwwMagCellImageContainer"" style=""margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; float: right;""><img border=""0"" alt=""celiac disease"" src=""/protocols/images/CeliacDisease/celiac_01.jpg"">  </div>
<p>Gluten  is not a single protein but rather a complex mixture of proteins, primarily <strong>gliadin</strong> and <strong>glutenin</strong>. Gluten forms when wheat flour is mixed with water to make  dough. The combination of gliadin, a viscous (thick) protein, with glutenin, a long, elastic protein, yields gluten with its unique “visco-elastic”  properties that are important in baking and food processing (Veraverbeke 2002; Allred 2010; Shewry 2002;  Tatham 2000).</p>
<p>Thus, despite the common usage of the  term “gluten-containing grains,” gluten itself is not actually present in the  wheat seed; it is created during the  formation of wheat flour dough (Hoseney 1990; Shewry 2002; Tilley 2001). </p>
<p>Rye and barley, the other “gluten”  grains, do not actually form gluten (Tatham 2000). Instead, <em>secalin</em> proteins in rye and <em>hordein</em> proteins in barley contain toxic  fragments that share properties with the wheat protein gliadin, most notably  with regard to triggering celiac disease (Kagnoff 2007; Denham 2013). For  convenience and simplicity, all three grains—wheat, rye, and barley—are  considered “gluten-containing grains.” </p>
<p>Gliadin  (wheat), secalin (rye), and hordein (barley) proteins are especially rich in  two amino acid “building-blocks,” proline and glutamine, and thus are called  “prolamins” (Stenman 2010; Hausch 2002;  Denham 2013; Stern 2000). The bonds linking proline and glutamine on the gluten  protein are resistant to digestion. This prevents complete breakdown of gluten  into small, harmless molecules. Instead, large, undigested gluten fragments  remain in the digestive tract (van den Broeck 2009; Kagnoff 2007; Denham 2013;  Gass 2007). </p>
<p>In  healthy people, these large, undigested fragments of gluten protein are  eventually harmlessly excreted and do not provoke an immune response (Fasano  2009). For people with celiac disease, however, these glutamine- and  proline-rich fragments, or peptides, are toxic (Sapone  2011; Holmes 2013; Volta 2013; Shan 2002). </p>

		<h3>IS LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE ALWAYS BETTER?</h3>
		<p>The concept that “lower is always better” in the context of aggressive blood pressure reduction can be a recipe for disaster, in particular for elderly, frail patients.</p>
		<p>Often told is the story of the young intern fresh from medical school graduation starting their residency. The intern aggressively treats their older patients to achieve rapid blood pressure reduction, yet is dismayed when their kidney function and cognitive abilities deteriorate rapidly.</p>
		<p>Wiser, more experienced physicians know that older patients with pronounced pre-existing vascular disease and other medical problems often require higher blood pressure to perfuse critical organs like the heart, kidneys, and brain. These patients require a higher <em>perfusion pressure</em> to allow blood to reach critical organs and tissues throughout the body.<sup>11</sup></p>
		<p>Some older patients simply do not tolerate aggressive blood pressure reduction to a predefined value, which requires careful monitoring of kidney function and blood tests for BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatinine, cystatin-C, and electrolytes like potassium and sodium, as well as assessment of cognitive function. These tests are necessary to facilitate appropriate titration of antihypertensive medication to a blood pressure tolerated by these patients.</p>

<p>Much  has been learned about how environmental and genetic factors interact with the  immune system to inflame and damage the lining of the small intestine in celiac  disease. The most important and best-characterized genetic components involved  in the development of celiac disease are known as <em>human leukocyte antigens</em> (HLAs). More than 98% of people with  celiac disease have at least one of two variants of a gene called HLA DQ. The  HLA DQ2 variant of this gene is found in approximately 95% of celiac patients,  while the HLA DQ8 variant is carried by the remainder. These genes play an  integral role in priming the autoimmune response to gluten that occurs in  celiac disease (Denham 2013; Sapone 2012; Green 2003).</p>
<p>Celiac disease is  characterized by increased intestinal permeability (“leaky gut”), which allows  gluten to seep through the compromised gut barrier and provoke a dysfunctional  immune response (Fasano 2009; Fasano 2008; Lionetti 2011).</p>
<p> During this inflammatory  immune assault against gluten, collateral damage to intestinal epithelial cells  causes leakage of their contents into the fluid surrounding the cells. Included  in this cellular discharge is a critical enzyme called <em>tissue transglutaminase</em> (Dieterich 1997; Fasano 2009). Tissue  transglutaminase modifies the composition of the gliadin peptide, enabling  gluten to bond strongly to the HLA DQ2 and DQ8 proteins. This then provokes an  immune response from the T and B cells of the immune system and the production  of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (Lionetti 2011; Denham 2013;  Fasano 2009). </p>
<p>The  helper T cells of the immune system trigger the release of cytokines (signaling  molecules), particularly interferon-gamma, which promote inflammation that  specifically targets the lining of the small intestine, resulting in the  autoimmune damage and flattening of the intestinal villi that are  characteristic of celiac disease (Lionetti 2011; Kagnoff 2007; Denham 2013).</p>
<h2>Villous Atrophy</h2>
<p>Nutrient  absorption occurs in the small intestine, a tube roughly 20–22 feet long with an  inner surface that, when magnified, appears wrinkled into hundreds of folds.  Each fold is covered with thousands of fingerlike projections called villi  (singular: villus). Each villus, in turn, is covered with thousands of tiny,  tightly packed projections called microvilli. Together, the villi and  microvilli increase the intestinal absorptive surface area 60–120 times  (Helander 2014; CARTA 2015; CHP 2014).  The villi also contain enzymes that help break down food particles to their  smallest components: proteins into amino acids, and carbohydrates into simple  sugars (Skovbjerg 1981; Nordström 1967).</p>
<p>In  celiac disease, intestinal damage induced by the autoimmune reaction to gluten  ingestion manifests as a flattening of the villi (a hallmark of celiac disease),  which reduces the surface area available for nutrient absorption. The resulting  malabsorption leads to both intestinal consequences such as indigestion and diarrhea,  and non-intestinal consequences such as anemia and osteoporosis (Kagnoff 2007;  Guandalini 2014; Lionetti 2011).</p>

<h3>Wheat  Allergy <em>vs.</em> Celiac Disease <em>vs.</em> Non-celiac Gluten Sensitivity</h3>
<p>Wheat allergy, celiac disease, and gluten  sensitivity are three separate conditions arising from distinct processes,  though they may share certain signs and symptoms (UCLA Health 2015; ACDA 2015a). The conventional medical definition  of <strong><em>wheat  or gluten allergy</em></strong> refers to a less common condition that affects about  0.4–0.5% of the general population and which classically involves <em>Immunoglobulin E </em>(IgE) antibodies to  wheat proteins, including gluten (Sapone 2012; Catassi 2013; Lundin 2012; Volta  2013). IgE antibodies play a central role in immediate food allergy reactions, the  kind that usually occur within minutes to several hours after ingesting the allergenic  food, though the reaction can occur up to two days later (Katta 2014). An allergy involves the release  of histamine and other inflammatory substances and can cause serious symptoms  such as skin eruptions, runny nose, itching, tearing, coughing, and in rare  cases, anaphylaxis and even death (Matsumura  1994; Sapone 2012). IgE reactions to foods can be measured by blood or  dermal testing (FARE 2015b; FARE 2015c).</p>
<p><strong><em>Celiac disease</em></strong> is an autoimmune disease, not an  allergy. Whereas allergic reactions tend to be transitory, appearing and  disappearing within minutes to hours after contact with an allergen such as  wheat, the autoimmune reactions of celiac disease are enduring and highly  destructive. Recovery of the normal structure of the intestinal lining takes 6–24  months of adherence to a strict gluten-free diet (Ferri 2015; Mayo Clinic 2014; UCLA Health 2015; ACDA 2015a).</p>
<p><strong><em>Non-celiac gluten sensitivity</em></strong> refers to a more recently-recognized  condition characterized primarily by a beneficial response to dietary  elimination of wheat-containing foods for people in whom celiac disease and  classical IgE-mediated wheat allergy have been ruled out. Whereas wheat or  gluten allergy and celiac disease are well-defined conditions, science still  has much to learn about non-celiac gluten sensitivity, including the mechanisms  underlying the condition and how best to diagnose it. Non-celiac gluten  sensitivity is neither an autoimmune condition nor a classical allergic  condition characterized by rapid IgE-mediated reactions (UCLA Health 2015; Sapone 2012). One study found that over half of  non-celiac gluten sensitivity patients tested positive for antigliadin  immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, and some researchers consider IgG antigliadin  antibody testing useful in identifying cases of non-celiac gluten sensitivity (Volta, Tovoli 2012; Mansueto 2014). A recent  clinical study suggests gluten or other proteins in wheat and related grains  may not be the sole cause of non-celiac reactivity to wheat. In some people, <em>fermentable, oligo-, di-, monosaccharides,  and polyols</em> (<strong>FODMAPs</strong>), which are  poorly absorbed carbohydrates, may contribute to sensitivity reactions to wheat  among people without overt celiac disease or wheat allergy (Biesiekierski 2013).</p>

<p>Some  people who do not have celiac disease or a wheat or gluten allergy may still  experience symptoms in response to gluten ingestion. These symptoms can  resemble those associated with celiac disease and may include gastrointestinal  symptoms and non-intestinal symptoms. This newly-recognized gluten-related  syndrome has been named <em>non-celiac wheat sensitivity</em> or <em>non-celiac gluten sensitivity</em>.  Current knowledge about non-celiac gluten sensitivity is limited, and many  unresolved questions remain to be clarified (Volta 2013; Sapone 2012).</p>
<p>Non-celiac  gluten sensitivity is not an autoimmune disease and does not result in the same  damage to the lining of the small intestine that is characteristic of celiac  disease. Overall, non-celiac gluten sensitivity is less severe than celiac  disease. The mechanism underlying the development of non-celiac gluten  sensitivity is not clear, though it is known to be different from that of  celiac disease and wheat allergy. There are conflicting reports, for example,  as to whether people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity have altered gut  barrier function (Biesiekierski 2011; Sapone 2011; Vazquez-Roque 2013).</p>
<p>As  in celiac disease, the fast-acting or “innate” immune system is activated in non-celiac  gluten sensitivity, causing moderate inflammation of the intestinal lining. However,  unlike celiac disease, most evidence indicates that the adaptive immune system  (also called acquired or specific immunity) is not activated in non-celiac  gluten sensitivity (Lundin 2012; Catassi 2013; Volta 2013; Sapone 2011; Goronzy 2012; Volta, Di Giorgio 2012).</p>
<p>Gluten  proteins may not be the sole or main triggers of non-celiac gluten sensitivity;  other non-gluten components in wheat may play a role as well (Bucci 2013; Biesiekierski 2013). For instance,  amylase-trypsin inhibitors are non-gluten proteins in wheat that are resistant  to digestion. They are the primary allergens in Baker’s asthma, an occupational  asthma that afflicts bakers and others exposed to grain and wheat flour dust (Salcedo 2011; James 1997). They can provoke  inflammation and immune reactions in the cells of celiac and non-celiac  patients, though their potential role in non-celiac gluten sensitivity has yet  to be explored (Junker 2012). </p>
<p>Other  non-protein constituents of wheat could elicit gastrointestinal symptoms in  people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity. <strong>FODMAPs</strong>—an  acronym for <em>fermentable oligo-, di-, and  monosaccharides and polyols</em>—are poorly digested and incompletely absorbed  carbohydrates found in a wide range of foods including gluten-containing  grains, fruits, foods made with high fructose corn syrup or sugar alcohols, and  dairy (SHC 2014).</p>
<p>FODMAPs  are easily fermented by gut bacteria, which can result in gas, bloating, and  diarrhea, symptoms shared by both irritable bowel syndrome and non-celiac  gluten sensitivity (Barrett 2012; Magge 2012).</p>
<p>A 2013 randomized controlled trial in 37 patients with non-celiac gluten  sensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome found that gluten did not produce  negative effects when FODMAPs were restricted in the diet. The study authors concluded  that non-celiac gluten sensitivity may not be distinct from reactions to  FODMAPs (Biesiekierski 2013).</p>

"<div><a id=""introduction"" name=""introduction""></a><p>Sinusitis is inflammation of the sinuses, which are small air-filled cavities within the bones of the face surrounding the nose (NIH 2012; NIAID 2012; MedlinePlus 2011; Mayo Clinic 2012a). Sinusitis symptoms include congestion, mucus discharge, and facial pain. The condition affects an estimated 16% of the United States adult population, resulting in millions of primary care office visits each year (Leung 2008; Smith 2012).</p>
<p><em>Sinusitis</em> should not be confused with <em>rhinitis,</em> which is characterized by inflammation associated with the mucosal surface of the nasal cavity (Hytonen 2012). However, since most cases of sinusitis also include symptoms of rhinitis, the term <em>rhinosinusitis </em>is often used(Fokkens 2005; NIH 2012). </p>
<p>Sinusitis can be <em>acute</em>, <em>subacute, chronic</em>, or <em>recurrent acute</em>; <em>c</em>ategorization is dependent upon duration and frequency of symptoms (Leung 2008; Radojicic 2010). Acute sinusitis typically causes mild symptoms that resolve on their own, but very rarely may progress into severe or even life-threatening complications, such as a brain abscess (Onisor-Gligor 2012; Boto 2011; Suhaili 2010; Ferri 2012). Chronic sinusitis causes persistent symptoms and is often difficult to treat (Leung 2008).</p>
<p>Conventional pharmaceutical options to reduce inflammation in the sinuses and nasal passages include corticosteroids and decongestants, though some people receive limited, or minimal, symptom relief (Rossberg 2005). Moreover, antibiotics are often needlessly overprescribed since most cases of acute sinusitis are caused by viruses, which do not respond to antibiotics, and chronic sinusitis can be caused by chronic inflammation or anatomic irregularities (Leung 2008; Mayo Clinic 2012c; PubMed Health 2012). The inappropriate use of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic-resistant organisms and an unnecessary increase in antibiotic-related adverse events such as diarrhea (Smith 2012; Guarch Ibanez 2011).</p>
<p>This protocol will describe the human sinuses as well as the causes, risk factors, and symptoms of sinusitis. Conventional treatment options will be examined along with an underutilized drug-free method for relieving sinusitis symptoms. Also, a variety of scientifically studied natural sinusitis therapies will be reviewed.</p>
<h2><strong>The Human Sinuses </strong></h2>
<p>The paranasal sinuses are 4 pairs of interconnected, mucous membrane-lined cavities that drain into the nasal cavity and are formed within the skull bones that surround the nose (Ogle 2012; NIAID 2012; AAFP 2011). Each of the sinus cavities are named after the particular facial bone(s) that shape(s) them, including (NIAID 2012): </p>

<td valign=""top"">Deeper behind the ethmoids, above the nose, and behind the eyes</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The sinuses circulate air and are lined with specialized cells that produce mucus and cells that possess tiny hairs called cilia (DeMuri 2009). The sinuses contain a thin layer of watery mucus that traps and filters out pathogens and other harmful particles from inhaled air, while the cilia rhythmically pulsate or “beat”, sweeping the stagnant mucus out of the sinuses and into the nasal cavity (AAFP 2008; NIAID 2012). In addition to catching unwanted material before it reaches the lungs, mucus and cilia also work together to warm and humidify the sinuses and nasal cavities so they remain moist and do not dry out during breathing (NIAID 2012; Jurkiewicz 2011). The sinuses also generate high concentrations of nitric oxide, a free radical and immune-mediator, which may serve to maintain sterility, strengthen immune defense against viruses and bacteria, and enhance the efficiency of cilia in clearing excess mucus (DeMuri 2009; Keir 2009). </p></div>",https://www.lifeextension.com/Protocols/Respiratory/Sinusitis/Page-02
"<div><a name=""risk"" id=""risk""></a>

<p>Several  risk factors for celiac disease are well established:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Race.</strong> Caucasians are generally at higher risk (Murray 2013;  Lidums 2015; A.D.A.M. 2014).</li>

  <li><strong>Gender.</strong> Among  women, the prevalence is 1.5–2.8 times higher than among men (Fasano, Catassi  2012; Gujral 2012).</li>

  <li><strong>Family  history.</strong> First- and second-degree relatives of celiac patients have  a 10- to 15-fold and a 2.5-fold increased risk, respectively, compared to the  general population (Bai 2013; Silvester 2013; Fasano,  Catassi 2012).</li>

  <li><strong>Genetics.</strong> Positive HLA DQ2 and DQ8 genes are almost always present in celiac disease  patients. Approximately 95% of celiac patients carry the HLA DQ2 gene, while  the remainder express the HLA DQ8 gene. Without one of these gene variants,  celiac disease is extremely rare and unlikely (Sapone 2012; Denham 2013; Fasano  2009).</li>

  <li><strong>Early  gluten exposure. </strong>Early introduction of gluten into an infant’s diet  increases risk. There is a 5-fold increased risk in children fed gluten during  their first three months of life; introduction of gluten to the diet of  genetically susceptible infants should be delayed until the 4th to 6th  month of life, and the mother should continue to breastfeed (Ferri 2015).<strong></strong></li>

  <li><strong>Breastfeeding  status.</strong> Not breastfeeding increases the risk of celiac disease in  childhood, and breastfeeding is protective. Gradually introducing  gluten-containing foods while breastfeeding decreases the risk up to 48%. It is  not known whether breastfeeding prevents adult onset of celiac disease (Lidums 2015).</li>
</ul>
<p>The  risk factors for non-celiac gluten sensitivity are not currently known, though  the condition is believed to occur more commonly in females and in young and  middle age adults (Catassi 2013).<strong></strong></p>

"<div><a id=""factors"" name=""factors""></a>
<p>In contrast to the <em>nasal passages</em> that are heavily colonized with bacteria, the <em>paranasal sinuses</em> are generally free from harmful bacteria or other pathogens (DeMuri 2009). However, the drainage openings (ostia) that allow the sinuses to empty into the nasal cavity are relatively small, and are thus vulnerable to becoming blocked easily (Merck 2006; Osguthorpe 2001). When this drainage system is blocked, the stagnant mucus begins to accumulate, allowing bacteria and other pathogens to colonize in the sinus cavity, resulting in inflammation and infection (ie, sinusitis) (NIH 2012A; Merck 2006). </p>
<p>Blockage of the ostia can occur as a result of direct mechanical obstruction, or injury that causes swelling in the nose (NIAID 2012; DeMuri 2009). The following table represents potential causes of ostia blockage (Leung 2008; NIH 2012; DeMuri 2009): </p>
<p><strong>Swelling Factors </strong></p>
<ul><li>Viral upper respiratory tract infection (ie, common cold)</li>
<li>Allergies (eg, hay fever) </li>
<li>Cystic fibrosis </li>
<li>Chemical inhalation (eg, tobacco smoke)</li>
<li>Immune disorders </li>
<li>Facial injury </li>
<li>Changes in atmospheric pressure (eg, flying, scuba diving)</li>
<li>Overusing nasal decongestant sprays </li></ul>
<p><strong> Mechanical &amp; Anatomical Obstructions</strong></p>
<ul><li>Deviated septum</li>
<li>Nasal polyps</li>
<li>Foreign body</li>
<li>Congenital deformity</li>
<li>Tumor</li>
<li>Nasal bone spur</li></ul>
<p>Although there are multiple risk factors that can contribute to ostia obstruction, allergic inflammation and viral upper respiratory infections (URIs) are the most significant (DeMuri 2009). Infection with a common cold virus is the most frequent cause of viral sinusitis (Mayo Clinic 2012b; Balkissoon 2010). Bacterial sinusitis is much less common, arising as a complication of viral sinusitis in about 0.5-2% of cases (Piccirillo 2004; Leung 2008).  </p>
<p>Other conditions that reduce the clearance of mucus from the sinuses can also contribute to sinusitis (DeMuri 2009). For instance, the common cold virus appears to impair mucus clearance from the sinuses by disrupting the structure and function of the cilia (AAFP 2008; DeMuri 2009). This increases the chances of developing sinusitis, particularly in the maxillary sinuses where the direction of drainage is against gravity (Leung 2008; AAFP 2008). </p>
<p>Since the function of cilia is largely dependent on the quality and quantity of the surrounding mucosal fluid, diseases that dry out the mucosal layer or affect its viscosity (eg, cystic fibrosis) may also contribute to sinusitis (DeMuri 2009; NIH 2012). Ostia blockage is also associated with an increase in mucosal viscosity because the trapped mucus begins to lose its water content. Likewise, sinus inflammation independently thickens sinus secretions through the release of inflammatory debris (NIAID 2012; DeMuri 2009). </p>
In rare cases, fungi can cause sinusitis (NIAID 2012). People with abnormal sinus structures or those with weakened immune systems are more vulnerable to fungal sinusitis (NIAID 2012; Mayo Clinic 2012b; Riechelmann 2011). Between 6 and 9% of all resistant rhinosinusitis cases that require surgery are attributable to fungal infection (Schubert 2009). Unfortunately, surgical treatment is usually needed, since evidence suggests that antifungal treatment is of little to no benefit in the management of chronic rhinosinuisitis due to fungal infection (Sacks 2011, 2012; Isaacs 2011). </div>",https://www.lifeextension.com/Protocols/Respiratory/Sinusitis/Page-03

  <h2> What is Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)?
  </h2>
<p>
    Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the chronic and progressively
    worsening scarring (fibrosis) of lung tissue. The cause of this fibrosis is
    not known (idiopathic). The lung tissue stiffens, making it increasingly
    difficult for those with IPF to breathe. IPF is generally irreversible and
    eventually leads to fatal respiratory failure.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, there are currently no cure for IPF. Treatments are
    available that can slow the progression of the disease, and lung
    transplants may extend life expectancy. There are, however, many recent
    advances in our understanding of the disease and exploration of treatment
    options that give cause for optimism.
</p>
<p>
There are also emerging and natural integrative interventions like    <strong>N-acetylcysteine</strong>, <strong>omega-3 fatty acids</strong> and
    senolytics such as <strong>quercetin</strong>, which are being explored for
    their anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects.
</p>
<h2> What Increases IPF Risk?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Genetic predisposition
  </li>
  <li>
     Environmental exposure to factors such as cigarette smoke, metal or wood
    dust, and sand
  </li>
  <li>
    Gastroesophageal reflux
  </li>
  <li>
     Certain viral infections such as hepatitis C and human herpes virus-8
  </li>
  <li>
    Age
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are the Signs and Symptoms of IPF?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Shortness of breath that worsens over time
  </li>
  <li>
    Dry cough
  </li>
  <li>
    Difficult or painful breathing
  </li>
  <li>
    Fatigue
  </li>
  <li>
    Weight loss
  </li>
  <li>
    Anxiety and depression
  </li>
  <li> “Crackling” sound in the lungs that can be heard with a stethoscope </li>
</ul>
<h2> What Treatments are Available for IPF?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Pulmonary rehabilitation, including exercise and education </li>
  <li>
    Oral corticosteroids to inhibit cough
  </li>
  <li>
    Psychological counseling after diagnosis
  </li>
  <li> Antifibrotic agents such as pirfenidone and nintedanib </li>
  <li> Lung transplant (uncommon for patients with IPF) </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Note: </strong>
  Conventional treatments for IPF are generally palliative and aim to
  alleviate symptoms and possibly slow disease progression. Only lung
  transplants have been shown to increase survival time.
</p>
<h2> What Novel and Emerging IPF Therapies Appear Promising?
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Mesenchymal stem cells</strong>
        to aid in repairing damaged lung tissue
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Senolytics</strong>
        such as quercetin to help clear inflammatory senescent cells
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Pentoxifylline</strong>, a drug generally used to improve vascular health, which has
      antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Antibodies </strong>
        against connective tissue growth factor to prevent fibrosis
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Leukotriene antagonists</strong>
        to decrease inflammation
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) pathway inhibitors</strong>
        to prevent recruitment of fibroblasts
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>mTOR inhibitors</strong>
        such as rapamycin to decrease signaling in fibroblasts, as increased
        mTOR signaling may accelerate fibrosis
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)</strong>
        to treat accompanying gastroesophageal reflux. PPIs have also been
        associated with slower IPF progression
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Metformin</strong>, an anti-diabetes drug, to decrease inflammation </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Glucagon-like peptide-1</strong>, a signaling protein that can inhibit inflammation in pulmonary
      fibrosis </li>
</ul>
<h2> What Natural Interventions May Be Beneficial for IPF?
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>N-acetylcysteine (NAC). </strong>
        NAC has reduced oxidative stress and inflammation and prevented
        fibrosis in animal models of IFP. Genetic variations may play a part in
        the varying effectiveness of NAC to treat IPF in humans.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Niacin and taurine. </strong>
        The combination of niacin (vitamin B3) and taurine has been shown in
        preclinical research to inhibit the activities of pro-fibrotic
        inflammatory molecules.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Omega-3 fatty acids. </strong>
        Several animal studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acids could
        protect against experimentally induced IPF-like conditions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). </strong>
        DHEA, an<strong> </strong>endogenous androgen hormone, decreases with
        age and appears to be significantly lower in those with IPF. DHEA
        inhibited lung fibroblast proliferation in a laboratory setting as
        well.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Vitamin D. </strong>
        Chronic vitamin D deficiency in laboratory animals has been shown to
        promote fibrosis in lung tissue. Supplementation with vitamin D also
        decreased toxin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Polyphenols. </strong>
Certain plant compounds including <strong>curcumin</strong>,<strong>quercetin</strong>, <strong>resveratrol</strong>,<strong>epigallocatechin gallate</strong> (EGCG), and        <strong>citrus flavonoids</strong> have demonstrated the ability to
        reduce fibrosis in animal models of IPF.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Phytochemicals.</strong> Other plant compounds including <strong>glycyrrhizic acid</strong>
        and <strong>ginsenoside Rg1</strong> have shown promise in preventing
        or reversing pulmonary fibrosis in animal models of IPF.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Note: </strong>
Most of the current research on natural interventions for IPF are animal or    <em>in vitro</em> studies. However, based on the current understanding of
    IPF’s underlying mechanisms, these integrative therapies are of interest
    and may prove to be beneficial to those with IPF, although randomized
    controlled trials involving human subjects are urgently needed.

  <h2>Celiac Disease</h2>
<p><strong>Signs, symptoms, and  possible manifestations.</strong> Symptoms of celiac disease are generally categorized as gastrointestinal  (typical) or extraintestinal (atypical) (see Table 2). Other forms of celiac  disease include <em>silent</em>, or  symptomless celiac disease, as well as <em>potential</em> celiac disease in which autoantibodies are detected but the intestinal lining  is undamaged (Sperandeo 2011; Fasano  2001; Di Sabatino 2009; Lionetti 2011). The absence of symptoms in silent  celiac disease can be attributed to the ability of the small intestine to  compensate for lost function in the damaged area, but only when the damage is  minimal. As intestinal damage progresses, symptoms appear (Presutti 2007).</p>
<p>In  recent years, more cases of atypical celiac disease and silent celiac disease  have been recognized (Telega 2008; Roma 2009; Guandalini 2014; Fasano, Catassi  2012). Many of the signs and symptoms of typical and atypical celiac, as well  as the diseases associated with celiac, can be at least partially attributed to  the nutrient malabsorption that results from damage to the absorptive surface  of the small intestine (Lidums 2015).</p>

<p><strong>Associated conditions.</strong> Celiac disease has been associated with  a number of other conditions, especially autoimmune-related conditions such as  type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease (Barker  2008; Kelly 2014). There is also some evidence that celiac disease may  increase risk of certain cancers. A large population study in over 30 000 adult  celiac patients corroborated earlier findings of increased risk of certain  cancers in celiac patients. In this population, non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurred  at a 1.94-fold increased incidence rate, and incidence of small intestinal  cancer was increased 4.29-fold, compared with rates expected in the general  population. The incidence of colon cancer and basal cell carcinoma were also  modestly elevated, by 1.35-fold and 1.13-fold, respectively (Ilus 2014; Green  2003). Table 3 summarizes conditions that may be associated with celiac  disease.</p>

<h2>Non-celiac Gluten Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Many  symptoms of non-celiac gluten sensitivity are similar to those of celiac  disease. As in celiac disease, they include symptoms similar to irritable bowel  syndrome such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and constipation; and  atypical symptoms such as headache, fatigue, joint and muscle pain, dermatitis,  depression, and anemia (Eswaran 2013; Sapone  2012; Volta 2013; Lundin 2012). The time interval between gluten exposure and  onset of symptoms in celiac disease can be quite long—up to weeks and  years—whereas it may be only a matter of a few hours to a few days in non-celiac  gluten sensitivity (Catassi 2013; Sapone 2012; Volta, De Giorgio 2012).</p>
<p>There  is no evidence that serious, long-term complications occur in non-celiac gluten  sensitivity (Catassi 2013).</p>
<table class=""protSidebar"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0""><tbody><tr><td>
  <h3>The  Effects of Gluten on the Brain and Nervous System</h3>
<p>Among atypical or extraintestinal signs  of celiac disease, brain and nervous system problems are prominent (Hu 2006;  Bushara 2005; Cascella 2011; Jackson 2012; Briani 2008; Rodrigo 2011; Nikpour 2012). </p>
<p>One mechanism for gluten’s effects on the  brain may involve autoimmune antibodies against a subtype of tissue  transglutaminase called <em>transglutaminase  6</em>. This enzyme is structurally similar to transglutaminase types involved  in intestinal and skin damage in celiac disease, but transglutaminase 6 is  found primarily in the brain and nervous system. Antibodies against this enzyme  have been identified in patients with gluten ataxia and schizophrenia.  Importantly, they do not appear to be present in healthy individuals  (Hadjivassiliou 2008; Cascella 2013). Whether antibodies to transglutaminase 6  are involved in other neurological and psychiatric conditions associated with  celiac disease is not known, and will require further research. However, there  is evidence that transglutaminase 6, and the transglutaminase enzyme family in  general, may be important in the development of degenerative diseases of the  brain (Thomas 2013; Jeitner 2009; De Vivo 2009;  Martin 2011).</p>
<p>Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory  autoimmune disorder that damages the insulating covers of nerve cells in the  brain and spinal cord (Compston 2002). Recently, the prevalence of celiac  disease was reported to be 5–10 times higher in a study in patients with  multiple sclerosis compared to the general population. All the patients in this  study had an excellent response to the gluten-free diet in an average of three  years, with regard to both digestive and neurological symptoms (Rodrigo 2011). </p>
<p>A 2014 case report showed celiac disease  can mimic multiple sclerosis. A 43-year-old male patient with a history of  diarrhea and colic since youth and neurological symptoms since age 18 was  diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at age 34. Seven years later, though his  blood tests did not show any of the typical celiac-related antibodies, he was  diagnosed with celiac disease based on neurologic signs and symptoms, positive  tests for HLA DQ2 and DQ8, and improvement in both digestive and neurological  symptoms on a gluten-free diet (Finsterer 2014).</p>

"<div><a id=""symptoms"" name=""symptoms""></a>
<p>Distinguishing between sinusitis and other nasal conditions such as allergic rhinitis and the common cold can be difficult since the symptoms are often similar (Balkissoon 2010). <em>Viral sinusitis</em> is the most common form of sinus infection, and typically produces symptoms similar to those of the common cold that last approximately 10 days (Smith 2012; Leung 2008; Balkissoon 2010). However, symptoms of acute <em>bacterial </em>sinusitis typically last 10-30 days and are more severe than those of the common cold or viral sinusitis (NIAID 2012; Balkissoon 2010; Leung 2008).</p>
<p>Throbbing facial pain or pressure is a prominent feature in many cases of sinusitis. This symptom typically originates in the same location as the affected sinus (eg, in the forehead, cheeks, nose, or between the eyes). The pain associated with sinusitis is a result of increased pressure caused by trapped air and mucus, which pushes on the sinus mucous membrane and bony wall behind it. Sinus pain can also be caused by negative pressure within the sinuses, which occurs due to blocked sinus openings that do not allow air to enter, thus creating a vacuum space (NIAID 2012). </p>
<p>Sinusitis is also often marked by a change in the characteristics of nasal secretions, which progress from clear and watery to thick and opaque (eg, white, yellowish, greenish, or blood-tinged) (DeMuri 2009; NIAID 2012). The mucus becomes thick because it loses its water content while trapped in the sinus cavity. It also becomes saturated with inflammatory mediators (NIAID 2012) and appears discolored as it mixes with neutrophils, a type of white blood cell (Rosenfeld 2007).</p>
<p>Other symptoms linked to sinusitis include (AAFP 2008, 2011; NIH 2012; Mayo Clinic 2012b): </p>
<ul><li>Headache</li>
<li>Postnasal drip</li>
<li>Sore throat</li>
<li>Reduced sense of smell and taste</li>
<li>Halitosis (ie, bad breath)</li>
<li>Ear pain/pressure</li>
<li>Nasal congestion and runny nose</li>
<li>Cough (may be worse at night)</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Aching teeth</li></ul>
<p>When symptoms of the common cold or viral sinusitis do not improve after 10 days or worsen after 5 days, bacterial sinusitis may be suspected (Balkissoon 2010; DeMuri 2009). </p>
<p>Sinusitis can be classified as follows (Radojicic 2010):</p>
<ul><li><em>Acute</em> – Symptoms last less than 4 weeks</li>
<li><em>Subacute</em> – Symptoms last from 4 to 8 weeks</li>
<li><em>Chronic</em> – Symptoms last longer than 8 weeks</li>
<li><em>Recurrent acute</em> – Symptoms occur 3 or more times per year and last less than 2 weeks</li></ul></div>",https://www.lifeextension.com/Protocols/Respiratory/Sinusitis/Page-04

  <h2>Celiac Disease</h2>
<p>A  blood test for immunoglobulin A (IgA) type autoimmune tissue transglutaminase  antibodies is usually the first diagnostic step for celiac disease in most  patients. Another test, IgA endomysial antibodies, may be used to confirm  positive results. Deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies are tested for when  serum IgA is low, a common occurrence in celiac disease (Ferri 2015; Rubio-Tapia 2013). Elevated antigliadin immunoglobulin  G (IgG) antibody levels may also present in people with celiac disease who have  recently consumed gluten. However, elevated IgG levels are not specific for  celiac disease, and healthy people may sometimes have elevated IgG levels.  Combined screening with IgG and IgA tests can be helpful in some cases,  especially in people with IgA deficiency, which is thought to occur in about  2‒3% of individuals with celiac disease (ACDA  2015b).</p>
<p>A  convenient screening panel, the Celiac Disease Antibody Screen, tests for  immunoglobulin A antibodies to tissue transglutaminase, the most important  blood test for celiac disease; serum immunoglobulin A levels, which can be low  in celiac disease; and deamidated gliadin immunoglobulin A (Rubio-Tapia 2013). </p>
<p>Blood  tests alone are often not considered adequate to confirm a diagnosis of celiac  disease. The gold standard for a celiac diagnosis is a biopsy of the small  intestine demonstrating flattened villi (Guandalini  2014; Gujral 2012; Rubio-Tapia 2013). </p>
<p>Genetic  testing for HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8 may be performed for three reasons: negative  tests rule out almost all cases of celiac disease, including those already on a  gluten-free diet; negative tests may help clarify the picture when the result  of other testing is unclear; and these tests are used to screen close relatives  of patients for genetic risk of celiac disease (those who are positive go on to  receive conventional testing as listed previously) (Ferri 2015; Kelly 2014; Lidums 2015). </p>
<p>A  simple “four-out-of-five” guideline has been proposed for the diagnosis of  celiac disease, which would require that a minimum of four out of the five  criteria below be met. Current practice guidelines, however, rely on more  complex diagnostic algorithms. Generally, a biopsy demonstrating villous  atrophy is still considered the “gold standard” for celiac diagnosis (Husby 2012; Rubio-Tapia 2013; Guandalini 2014;  Ludvigsson 2014; Sapone 2012).</p>

<h3>
  Distinguishing  Celiac Disease from Irritable Bowel Syndrome </h3>
<p>The misdiagnosis of celiac disease as  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) deserves special mention. Individuals diagnosed  with IBS are considered to be at four- to seven-fold increased risk of celiac  disease compared with the general population (Cristofori  2014; Sanders 2001). However, proper diagnosis of IBS necessarily  includes ruling out conditions such as celiac disease (Moleski 2013). </p>
<p>Typical gastrointestinal presentation of  celiac disease may closely mimic the symptoms of IBS, including recurrent  abdominal discomfort, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea (Lidums 2015; Verdu 2009). Patients who have received a  diagnosis of IBS should confirm that celiac disease was adequately tested for  and ruled out (Rodrigo 2013; Ford 2009; Zwolińska-Wcisło 2009; Spiegel 2004;  Sanders 2001). More information on IBS can be found in Life Extension’s <a href=""http://www.lef.org/Protocols/Gastrointestinal/Irritable-Bowel-Syndrome/Page-01"">Irritable Bowel Syndrome</a> protocol.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<h2>Non-celiac Gluten Sensitivity</h2>
<p>While  there are currently no universally recognized laboratory tests or biomarkers  for non-celiac gluten sensitivity, wheat allergy and celiac disease must be  ruled out in order to make a non-celiac gluten sensitivity diagnosis (Czaja-Bulsa 2014; Sapone 2012). The best  available procedure to confirm non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a double-blind,  placebo-controlled gluten challenge that demonstrates that gluten-related  symptoms are relieved by a gluten-free diet (Volta 2013; Sapone 2012).</p>
</div>",https://www.lifeextension.com/Protocols/Gastrointestinal/Celiac-Disease-and-Non-Celiac-Gluten-Sensitivity/Page-08
"<div><a name=""gluten"" id=""gluten""></a>

<p>The  only established treatment for celiac disease is strict, lifelong adherence to  a gluten-free diet (Ferri 2015; Kelly 2014;  Lidums 2015; Fasano, Catassi 2012). Absolute compliance to the  gluten-free diet is vital, as even a tiny amount of gluten can lead to  intestinal damage in those with celiac disease. In most cases, with strict  adherence, symptoms are halted, existing intestinal damage is healed, and  further damage is prevented (UCMC 2013).</p>
<p>The  gluten-free diet excludes all foods that contain wheat (including spelt,  triticale, and kamut), rye, and barley (Dirks  2004; Bai 2013). This means avoiding these grains, as well as pasta,  cereals, and processed foods—unless they are labeled “gluten-free.” The status  of oats in the gluten-free diet is less clear; it is thought that most celiac  patients can eat modest amounts of <em>pure</em> oats, though some celiac patients do not tolerate oats (Fasano, Catassi 2012; Real  2012). Unless labeled “gluten-free,” oats should be avoided as they can be  contaminated with gluten-containing grains (UCMC 2013; Kagnoff 2007). </p>
<p>There  are many gluten-free alternatives to wheat: amaranth, buckwheat, corn, millet,  rice (all varieties), quinoa, sorghum, teff, yucca, potato, nuts, flax, and all  beans and legumes are naturally gluten-free (CDF  2015). There are also alternatives to gluten-containing flour, including  potato, rice, soy, tapioca, carob, and bean flour (Zingone 2010; Eberman 2005). </p>
<p>The  gluten-free diet is typically considered the primary treatment for non-celiac  gluten sensitivity (though some researchers advocate avoidance of FODMAPs as  opposed to gluten). While the level of gluten tolerance varies among  individuals with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, with rare exceptions, most of  these individuals can eat trace amounts of gluten without negative health  consequences (Molina-Infante 2014; Sapone 2012; Volta 2013).</p>
<p>Unfortunately,  lifelong strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is often difficult. Gluten is  common in many types of food, and gluten-free products are often expensive and  not widely available. Many people have difficulty maintaining the diet (Vahedi  2003; Abdulkarim 2002).</p>

  <h3>Avoiding  FODMAPs: Potential Benefits for Those with Non-celiac Gluten Sensitivity?</h3>
<p>Although several studies have identified  specific reactions to the protein components of wheat and related grains in  some people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, limited evidence suggests that  poorly absorbed carbohydrates called <em>fermentable,  oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols</em> (FODMAPs) may drive symptoms in  some individuals (Biesiekierski 2013; El-Salhy  2015).  </p>
<p>In one study of people with self-reported  non-celiac gluten sensitivity, reducing FODMAP intake significantly reduced  gastrointestinal symptoms (Biesiekierski 2013).  Thus, avoiding dietary FODMAPs may be beneficial for gluten-sensitive  individuals who fail to achieve relief by specifically avoiding gluten.  Limiting FODMAP intake has also been shown to improve symptoms among  individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which has several similarities  with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (Lowe 2014;  Staudacher 2014).</p>
<p>The low-FODMAP diet emphasizes avoidance  of fructose, lactose, fructans, galactans, and polyols. Some examples of foods  eliminated in a low-FODMAP diet are wheat, barley, and rye; high-lactose dairy;  foods made with high-fructose corn syrup; certain fruits; soy protein;  mushrooms; among others (SUMC 2014).</p>
<p>Monash University in Australia has  developed a comprehensive low-FODMAP diet program to assist individuals who  wish to try this dietary approach. More information is available on Monash  University’s website, here: <a href=""http://www.med.monash.edu/cecs/gastro/fodmap/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.med.monash.edu/cecs/gastro/fodmap/</a>.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

"<div><a name=""novel"" id=""novel""></a>

<p>In light of the limitations of the  gluten-free diet, several new treatment strategies for celiac disease are  currently under development. These novel and emerging therapies can be  classified into four general categories: <em>permeability  inhibition</em>, <em>immunomodulation</em>, <em>grain modification</em>, and <em>gluten detoxification</em>.</p>
<p>While ongoing research on novel therapies  is targeting celiac disease, some of the dietary modification and gluten  detoxification strategies described in this section may provide solutions for  people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity.</p>
<h2>Permeability Inhibition</h2>
<p><strong>Zonulin antagonism. </strong>Zonulin is a protein that regulates the  tight junctions that “glue” intestinal cells together and control what passes  through the gut wall. In celiac disease, overproduction of zonulin causes these  tight junctions to come apart and remain open, increasing intestinal  permeability (Tripathi 2009; Fasano 2012a).  This “leaky gut” then allows large molecules, including gluten fragments, to  enter the bloodstream, where they trigger an immune response and inflammation  (Fasano 2012b; Fasano 2011; van Elburg 1993).<strong></strong></p>
<p>An  investigational drug named larazotide acetate blocks zonulin from making the  gut permeable, and appears to be effective in preventing gluten-related  symptoms in celiac disease (Gopalakrishnan 2012). In a randomized controlled  trial in patients with celiac disease, acute gluten exposure caused a 70%  increase in intestinal permeability in the placebo group, while no change in  permeability was seen in the larazotide group. The patients treated with larazotide  tolerated the drug well and experienced fewer gastrointestinal symptoms.  Moreover, larazotide-treated subjects exhibited a lessened inflammatory  response to gluten in comparison with the placebo group, as determined by  changes in levels of several inflammatory cytokines (Paterson 2007).</p>
<p>A  more recent phase IIb trial evaluated larazotide in 342 celiac patients who did  not respond to a gluten-free diet. Compared with controls, patients taking the  zonulin-inhibitor at the lowest dose (0.5 mg daily) had significantly fewer  gastrointestinal symptoms and headaches, as well as less fatigue. No changes in  serum levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase or gliadin antibodies were seen  (AGA 2014; Castillo 2014). The drug producer, Alba Therapeutics, is planning  for phase III clinical trials of lazarotide’s efficacy and safety (AZO Network 2014). Larazotide acetate has been  granted fast-track designation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which  is a process by which therapies that help address an unmet medical need may be  approved and become available in the market more quickly (PR Newswire 2014).</p>
<h2>Immunomodulation</h2>
<p><strong>Vaccination. </strong>A preventive vaccine may be one of the  most attractive and exciting novel therapies for patients with celiac disease  (Aziz 2011). The theory behind vaccination is that tolerance to gluten can be  induced through repeated small exposures to strongly immunogenic fragments of  gluten. The immune system becomes trained to not react to gluten, thus  preventing an autoimmune attack in the small intestine (Bakshi 2012). Just this  type of gluten vaccine (Nexvax2) is under development. Nexvax2 is a mixture of  the three toxic peptides—gliadin (wheat), hordein (barley), and secalin (rye)—that  provoke the immune system in individuals with HLA DQ2-positive genes. Nexvax2  was shown to be safe and well tolerated in a three-week phase I clinical trial  in celiac patients (Castillo 2014; Rashtak 2012; Bakshi 2012). Phase II and III  clinical trials will be necessary before FDA approval.</p>
<p><strong>Inhibition of tissue  transglutaminase 2. </strong>Tissue  transglutaminase 2 (tTG2) is an enzyme that leaks out of damaged cells and  modifies gluten. It is this modified gluten that is presented to immune cells,  eventually leading to autoimmune and inflammatory responses in the intestine.  As tTG2 is vital to the development of celiac disease, selective inhibition of  tTG2 could be another potential therapeutic approach for celiac disease (Kupfer 2012; Esposito 2007; Siegel 2007).<strong></strong></p>
<p>However,  tTG2 has many other diverse biological functions such as wound healing and  assisting the ingestion of microbes or other foreign particles by immune cells  (Siegel 2007). Therefore, inhibiting tTG2 may result in systemic side effects.  Nevertheless, in animal studies a series of compounds called dihydroisoxazoles  were shown to efficiently inhibit tTG2 with low systemic toxicity (Choi 2005;  Watts 2006). Inhibition of tTG2 is still in the discovery phase with no  clinical trials yet initiated.</p>
<p><strong>Blocking HLA DQ2 and HLA  DQ8. </strong>In celiac disease,  the human leukocyte antigens HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8 bind with gluten peptides and  induce an immune reaction that leads to disease development. Blocking the  binding sites of these HLA antigens may provide yet another treatment  alternative. Various gluten analogues (structurally similar to gluten) have  been developed that effectively bind and inhibit HLA DQ2, which is present in  over 90% of cases of celiac disease (Juse 2010; Huan 2011; Kapoerchan 2008; Xia  2007). The primary concern with these HLA antagonists is the possibility of  interfering with other similar HLAs that are involved in normal immune  surveillance. This strategy is still in the discovery phase (Rashtak 2012).<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Anti-interferon-gamma and  anti-TNF-alpha therapies.</strong> Interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) are cytokines  (signaling molecules) that are activated by gluten’s interaction with T cells  of the immune system. These cytokines contribute to the inflammatory cascade in  celiac disease. Interventions that block these cytokines have been investigated  in celiac disease. Infliximab (Remicade), an anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody  used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease  and ulcerative colitis, was beneficial in two case reports of unresponsive  celiac disease (Guo 2013; Nilsen 1998; Pena 1998;  Gillett 2002; Costantino 2008; Woodward  2013).<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Anti-interleukin-15  therapy. </strong>Interleukin-15  (IL-15) is another cytokine that plays a significant role in the development of  celiac disease. Genetically altered mice that produce excess IL-15 in  intestinal cells develop inflammation along with flattening of the villi in the  small intestine, much like the damage that occurs in celiac disease. One trial  showed that in mice, blocking IL-15 with antibodies reversed this autoimmune  damage (Yokoyama 2009). AMG 714, an anti-IL-15 antibody, is being evaluated in phase  II clinical trials for the autoimmune diseases rheumatoid arthritis (Amgen  2007) and psoriasis (Amgen 2014). Targeting IL-15 is a plausible treatment  strategy for celiac disease as well, though human trials are still lacking (Sollid 2011).<strong></strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>CCR9 antagonists. </strong>The chemokine receptor CCR9 acts as a  trafficking or homing molecule that selectively causes T cells to move to the  small intestine, where they promote persistent inflammation. This homing  receptor has been associated with celiac disease (Olaussen 2007). An antagonist  to CCR9 called CCX282-B induced a clinical response and maintenance of clinical  remission in Crohn’s disease (Keshav 2013). A phase II trial of CCX282-B in  celiac disease has been completed, but results are pending. Due to a lack of  specificity, this drug may increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections (Stoven 2013; Sollid 2011).</p>
<h2>Grain  Modification</h2>
<p><strong>Wheat  variants. </strong>The  development and production of variant wheat strains that contain reduced levels  of toxic gluten proteins is one novel approach currently under exploration.  Success in this endeavor might allow people to consume wheat while reducing  their exposure to gluten. Several studies have reported that various species of  ancient wheat (einkorn) and some strains of pasta wheat (durum) contain little  to no immunogenic gluten peptides. It appears that ancient forms of wheat  contained less total gluten and toxic gluten fragments than modern bread wheat  (Molberg 2005; Spaenij-Dekking 2005).</p>
<p>Research efforts are focused on breeding  wheat strains similar to ancient wheat that lack harmful gluten peptides. Identification  and breeding of grain varieties with less immunotoxic profiles is in  development (Molberg 2005).  </p>
<h2>Gluten  Detoxification</h2>
<p><strong>Enzyme  therapy. </strong>Enzyme therapy  is a promising new intervention designed to detoxify gluten. Certain  protein-digesting enzymes (proteases) derived from plants and microorganisms can  completely break down gluten peptides into harmless fragments. One such enzyme  preparation, AN-PEP, is a proline-specific protease extracted from the common  fungus <em>Aspergillus niger</em>. This enzyme  specifically cleaves the proline-rich gliadin peptides, making them less  immunogenic. Experiments with cell cultures demonstrated that AN-PEP can  withstand the strongly acidic environment of the stomach, and fully digest  gluten and immunogenic peptides (Stepniak 2006). Human clinical trials are  underway to confirm this.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Another protease, ALV003, is further  along in development and appears to have greater therapeutic potential.  Composed of a proline-specific protease and a glutamine-specific protease  called EP-B2, this two-enzyme combination was shown to be superior to either  enzyme alone (Siegel 2006; Siegel 2012).  According to a phase II trial, ALV003 appeared to reduce gluten-induced small  intestinal damage in patients with celiac disease who were challenged with up  to 2 g gluten per day while following a gluten-free diet (Lähdeaho 2014). A  500-person multi-center trial is currently ongoing (Adelman 2014).</p>

"<div><a id=""diagnosis"" name=""diagnosis""></a>
<p>Sinusitis is usually diagnosed based upon a physician’s assessment of a patient’s symptoms and medical history. In some cases, when a patient presents with a history of upper respiratory infection and symptoms lasting from 7 to 10 days, a bacterial culture may be obtained. Some other procedures can help aid diagnosis, but are typically not required in uncomplicated cases; these include radiography, computed tomography, endoscopic visualization of ostia secretions, and sinus puncture in cases that have failed other treatments (Fort 2012).<strong></strong></p>
<p>Conventional treatment recommendations for acute sinusitis are largely dependent upon the underlying cause of infection (Mayo Clinic 2012b). The majority of sinusitis cases are caused by viral infection, and antibiotics are generally not needed in these cases (AAFP 2011; Mayo Clinic 2012b; Smith 2012). Since the symptoms of viral sinusitis are mild-to-moderate and typically resolve on their own within 10 days or less, they can often be managed via self-care techniques and/or home remedies (Leung 2008; Mayo Clinic 2012b; Smith 2012; Puhakka 1998). <strong></strong></p>
<p>The following self-care strategies may provide relief from sinusitis symptoms: </p>
<ul><li>Adequate rest to help the body fight infection and speed-up recovery (AAFP 2008; Mayo Clinic 2012b).</li>
<li>Elevate the head while sleeping by using an extra pillow to reduce congestion and keep the sinuses draining properly (AAFP 2008; Mayo Clinic 2012b).</li>
<li>Stay hydrated with water, as this helps to thin out mucus secretions and promote drainage (Mayo Clinic 2012b; NIH 2012). Sipping hot beverages may also help, since they can dilate blood vessels and promote drainage (AAFP 2008; Merck 2008).</li>
<li>Avoid alcohol and caffeine consumption, since they can cause dehydration and contribute to nasal and sinus swelling (AAFP 2008; Mayo Clinic 2012b).</li>
<li>Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet, which includes plenty of fruits and vegetables; a diet rich in antioxidants may boost immune function and help fight infection (NIH 2012). </li>
<li>Try steam inhalation 3-4 times daily to open sinus passages, which can reduce pain and help clear mucus (AAFP 2011). This can be done by draping a towel over the head and inhaling rising steam from a bowl of hot water (Mayo Clinic 2012b). Breathing in the warm, moist air of a hot shower or use of a humidifier may also be beneficial (AAFP 2011; Mayo Clinic 2012b; NIH 2012).</li>
<li>Apply a warm, damp towel to painful sinus areas several times a day (AAFP 2008; Mayo Clinic 2012b; NIH 2012).</li>
<li>Rinse out nasal passages with a saline nasal spray several times a day. This helps to reduce congestion by loosening mucus and cleaning out sinuses and nasal passages (AAFP 2008, 2011; Balkissoon 2010; Mayo Clinic 2012b; NIH 2012). This technique may also have a moisturizing effect, which can reduce the crusting of nasal secretions (Balkissoon 2010). Nasal irrigation with a sea salt solution appears to be as effective as saline nasal wash and topical nasal steroids for the management of chronic rhinosinusitis (Friedman 2006, 2012).</li></ul>
<p>Treatment with one or more of the following medications may also help:</p>
<ul><li style=""list-style-type:none""><strong>Decongestants</strong> – Also known as α-adrenergic agonists, decongestants cause blood vessel constriction, thereby reducing airway resistance by increasing the size of the airway lumen (Balkissoon 2010; DeMuri 2009; Corboz 2008). Oral decongestants such as pseudoephedrine (eg, Sudafed™) are less potent than topical nasal decongestant sprays such as oxymetazoline (eg, Afrin™) and phenylephrine (eg, Neo-Synephrine™) (Balkissoon 2010). Unlike topical nasal decongestants, oral decongestants are associated with systemic side effects, including increased blood pressure, restlessness, insomnia, and urinary retention (Balkissoon 2010; DeMuri 2009). Although topical nasal decongestants are preferred for these reasons, their use should be limited to no more than 3-5 consecutive days. This is because they quickly induce tolerance, which means that higher and higher doses will be needed to achieve the same effect (Balkissoon 2010). Furthermore, if a nasal decongestant spray is overused and then abruptly stopped, an extreme increase in nasal congestion (ie, rebound congestion) may be experienced (Mayo Clinic 2012b; Balkissoon 2010). Similarly, continued overuse of nasal decongestant sprays can cause a phenomenon known as rhinitis medicamentosa, in which congestion worsens despite continued or even increased medication use (Doshi 2009).<br><br></li>
<li style=""list-style-type:none""><strong>Mild analgesics </strong>– Over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol™), or ibuprofen (Advil™ or Motrin™) may be helpful for temporarily relieving sinus pain and headache (Mayo Clinic 2012b; AAFP 2008). Refer to the <strong><a href=""/protocols/appendix/otc_toxicity_01.htm"">Acetaminophen and NSAID Toxicity</a> </strong>protocol especially when using acetaminophen over an extended period.<br><br></li>
<li style=""list-style-type:none""><strong>Intranasal corticosteroids</strong> – Although nasal steroids may decrease the inflammatory response associated with sinusitis, clinical trials have shown conflicting results (DeMuri 2009). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved their use for the treatment of acute sinusitis (Leung 2008). However, nasal steroids may still be of benefit, since they are able to decrease swelling of the sinus passages associated with allergies and allow the sinuses to drain (NIAID 2012). As a result, nasal steroids may be of benefit to individuals whose nasal allergies (eg, hay fever) predispose them to developing sinusitis (DeMuri 2009).<br><br></li>
<li style=""list-style-type:none""><strong>Antibiotics</strong> – Although bacterial sinusitis is less common and more severe than viral sinusitis, it may resolve without the need for antibiotics (Mayo Clinic 2012b). As a result, sinusitis treatment guidelines do not recommend taking antibiotics within the first week of illness, unless the symptoms are particularly severe (eg, high fever or extreme pain). The cautious use of antibiotics for the treatment of sinusitis is warranted because they are not usually helpful, and are also associated with negative side effects, antibiotic resistance, and increased medical costs (Smith 2012). If deemed necessary,  antibiotics that  may be prescribed include amoxicillin, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Mayo Clinic 2012b). A typical course of antibiotic treatment for severe bacterial sinusitis will last for 10-14 days, and should not be discontinued early just because the symptoms have resolved (Balkissoon 2010).</li></ul>
<p><strong>Surgical intervention</strong> is usually a last resort, and thus reserved for cases of chronic sinusitis that have not responded to drug therapy (DeMuri 2009; NIAID 2012). For example, allergic fungal sinusitis represents up to 9% of all sinusitis cases requiring surgery (Schubert 2009). The goal of surgery is to improve drainage by removing or reducing sinus obstruction (NIAID 2012). Most surgical procedures for sinusitis are aided by endoscopic visualization (DeMuri 2009). Surgery can be performed to enlarge sinus openings, remove nasal polyps, and correct anatomical abnormalities (eg, deviated septum) (DeMuri 2009; NIAID 2012; NIH 2012). For most patients, surgery results in lasting symptom improvement and an increased quality of life (DeMuri 2009; NIAID 2012); however, symptoms may reoccur (NIAID 2012).</p>
<table class=""protSidebar"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0""><tbody><tr><td><h2><strong>Drug-free sinusitis relief with <em><u>therapeutic ultrasound</u></em></strong></h2>
<p>Chronic sinusitis is notoriously difficult to treat and causes significant suffering for those it afflicts. Antibiotics and/or corticosteroid therapies may fail to provide relief in some cases, leaving surgery as a last resort (Leung 2008).</p>
<p><strong><em>Therapeutic ultrasound</em></strong>, in which low-frequency ultrasound waves are applied to the sinuses, appears to be an effective drug-free treatment for chronic, as well as acute sinusitis, with little potential for side effects (Patel 2012).</p>
<p>In a 2010 study on 22 subjects with a history of chronic rhinosinusitis that had failed aggressive medical management, therapeutic ultrasound 3 days per week for 6 sessions lead to a 34% improvement on a standardized assessment of sinusitis symptoms (Young 2010). A 2012 study on 30 chronic rhinosinusitis patients who received therapeutic ultrasound 3 days per week for 10 sessions revealed a reduction of sinusitis symptoms of up to 65% (Ansari 2012). A 2010 case report showed that this same treatment regimen resolved sinusitis symptoms in a patient who had been suffering from chronic sinusitis for a year. After the treatment the patient only experienced mild nasal obstruction (Ansari 2010). In a larger 2010 trial involving 42 subjects with acute sinusitis, therapeutic ultrasound administered for 4 consecutive days provided as much relief from symptoms as the antibiotic amoxicillin (Hosoien 2010).</p>
<p>Therapeutic ultrasound has been shown to disrupt <strong><em>biofilms </em></strong>(Karosi 2012). A Biofilm is a layer of mucus-like film secreted by some pathogens that helps infectious organisms colonize a surface. Organisms embedded in a biofilm are very difficult to eradicate. In the sinus cavities, biofilms appear to contribute to persistent infection and are associated with sinusitis (Biel 2011; Bezerra 2009). Therapeutic ultrasound appears to disrupt biofilm, which may contribute to its efficacy in relieving sinusitis symptoms (Karosi 2012; Patel 2012; Young 2010).</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>",https://www.lifeextension.com/Protocols/Respiratory/Sinusitis/Page-05
"<div><a name=""integrative"" id=""integrative""></a>

<h2>Iron</h2>
<p>Iron-deficiency  anemia is one of the most common extraintestinal signs of celiac disease (Horowitz 2011; Caruso 2013); iron deficiency  without anemia may also occur. Although iron deficiency is usually corrected by  a gluten-free diet, restoration of iron levels can require 6–12 months <em>after</em> the lining of the small intestine  has healed (Caruso 2013). Blood tests for iron deficiency, including a complete  blood count and ferritin level, are important in diagnosis (Ferri 2015) and iron supplementation is  considered part of necessary care for celiac patients, in part due to the  nutritional insufficiency possible with a gluten-free diet (Thompson 2000; Kupper 2005; Lidums 2015; Kelly 2014).</p>
<h2>Calcium </h2>
<p>In  celiac disease, damage to the intestinal lining often leads to calcium  malabsorption and decreased serum levels of calcium (Rastogi 2012; Pantaleoni  2014; Babar 2011; Szymczak 2012), which then lead to bone loss, osteopenia,  osteoporosis, and increased fracture risk (AGA 2001; Pantaleoni 2014).<strong> </strong>Calcium levels and bone mineral  density improve on a gluten-free diet, but only after one to two years (Caruso 2013; Molteni 1995). However, a  gluten-free diet can be low in calcium, and can lead to calcium deficiency (Kupper 2005; UCMC 2013; Blazina 2010) and  subsequent low bone mineral density (Blazina 2010). Thus, supplementation with  calcium is important for patients with celiac disease (Rastogi 2012; Mancini  2011; Szymczak 2012; Blazina 2010; Lucendo 2013; Caruso 2013; Bianchi 2008).</p>
<h2>Vitamin D</h2>
<p>Vitamin  D deficiency is a common problem in celiac disease and is associated with a  range of musculoskeletal disorders including bone pain, muscle disorders  (myopathy), loss of bone mineral density, osteopenia, and osteoporosis (Mulder 2011; Rastogi 2012; Rabelink 2011; Karaahmet  2014; Caruso 2013). One study found low vitamin D levels in 64% of men  and 71% of women with celiac disease (Kemppainen 1999). Importantly, however,  this study defined vitamin D “deficiency” as below 10 ng/mL 25-hydroxyvitamin  D, which is far below levels considered optimal. Also, evidence suggests serum  vitamin D levels decrease with age in individuals with celiac disease, and low  levels occur even in sunny climates (Lerner 2012). A case report described a  celiac patient with myopathy and a vitamin D level below 4 ng/dL. The patient  was started on a gluten-free diet and initiated vitamin D supplementation at a  dose of 300 000 IU once every two weeks, while under physician supervision. The  patient’s symptoms resolved within a week (Karaahmet  2014). </p>
<p>Supplementation  with vitamin D and calcium, along with a gluten-free diet, has been shown to  markedly improve bone status in celiac patients (Duerksen  2012; Bianchi 2008; Rastogi 2012), and supplementation with vitamin D  and calcium is widely recommended for celiac patients (Szymczak 2012; Lucendo  2013; Rastogi 2012). Vitamin D has many additional functions beyond its role in  the musculoskeletal system, particularly modulation of the immune system and  anti-inflammatory effects. Data from laboratory studies provide evidence for  vitamin D’s potential to decrease systemic inflammation and prevent autoimmune  disease in humans (Richards 2007; Kriegel  2011; Agmon-Levin 2013; Antico 2012). Specifically, vitamin D inhibits  secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma and TNF-α,  while promoting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-4,  IL-5, and IL-10 (Prietl 2013). </p>
<p>Blood  tests for 25-hydroxyvitamin D can determine baseline levels and monitor changes  in levels resulting from vitamin D supplementation and a gluten-free diet. </p>
<h2>B Vitamins</h2>
<p>Deficiencies  of folate and vitamins B12 and B6 are common in celiac  disease (Dickey 2002; Haapalahti 2005; Tikkakoski 2007; Dahele 2001; Reinken  1978; Caruso 2013), and supplementation with these B vitamins, and also niacin (vitamin  B3) and riboflavin (vitamin B2), is considered an  important part of conventional care for celiac patients (Hadithi 2009; Caruso  2013; Wierdsma 2013; Halfdanarson 2007; Lidums  2015). In one study, folate and pyridoxal 5’-phosphate, the active form  of vitamin B6, were deficient in 37% and 20% of adult celiac  patients, respectively, who had been on a gluten-free diet for 10 years and who  exhibited biopsy-proven recovery. Among the participants in this study, mean  daily folate and vitamin B12 intake were significantly lower in  those with celiac than in controls (Hallert 2002).</p>
<p>Homocysteine  is an amino acid derivative that can damage the lining of blood vessels and  promote atherosclerotic disease (Eren 2014;  Pushpakumar 2014). Elevated homocysteine is often attributable to a lack  of vitamins B12, B6, and folate, which are necessary for  the metabolism of homocysteine (Higdon 2014a; Higdon 2014b). Several studies  have demonstrated elevated blood levels of homocysteine in celiac patients  (Hallert 2002; Dickey 2008; Saibeni 2005). One study showed celiac patients who  took vitamin supplements had higher blood levels of folate and vitamins B6  and B12, and lower levels of homocysteine, compared with those who  did not use supplements (Hadithi 2009).  Deficiency  in folate and vitamin B12 can cause B-deficiency anemia, which is  common in celiac disease, occurring in up to 34% of untreated patients  (Wierdsma 2013; Halfdanarson 2007). </p>
<h2>Magnesium</h2>
<p>Magnesium  is an essential mineral involved in hundreds of enzymatic reactions in the body  (Higdon 2013a). Magnesium is also required for proper metabolism of vitamin D  and calcium, and thus for bone health (Zofkova 1995; Hardwick 1991). </p>
<p>The  importance of magnesium deficiency in celiac disease was first recognized over  fifty years ago, when a detailed case report showed a dramatic improvement in  magnesium absorption and status in a young adult celiac patient after she  commenced a gluten-free diet (Goldman 1962).  Another study investigated magnesium status in children and adolescents with  celiac disease. While all of the patients with classical celiac disease (with  malabsorption) were magnesium deficient, only 1 in 5 patients on a gluten-free  diet (no malabsorption) and 1 in 5 patients with silent celiac disease (no  malabsorption) were low in magnesium (Rujner 2001). A later study examined  magnesium in 41 children and adolescents with celiac disease or normal  intestinal villi who had been on a gluten-free diet for an average of 11 years;  28 patients with untreated atypical celiac disease and eight controls were also  included in the study. The researchers found magnesium deficiency, as assessed  by red blood cell magnesium levels, in 14.6% of those on the gluten-free diet  and 25% of untreated patients (Rujner 2004).</p>
<p>An  earlier study in 23 adult celiac patients found that all of them had depleted  intracellular magnesium levels despite being asymptomatic (no malabsorption)  and on a gluten-free diet. Magnesium therapy in these individuals resulted in  increases in both red blood cell magnesium and bone mineral density, suggesting  magnesium deficiency may play a role in the development of osteoporosis in people  with celiac disease (Rude 1996). Screening for magnesium status and deficiency,  and magnesium supplementation and dietary enrichment, are considered essential  aspects of care for celiac patients (Ferri 2015;  Lidums 2015; Caruso 2013).</p>
<h2>Zinc</h2>
<p>Zinc  is an essential nutrient mineral that acts as a catalytic agent for over 300  separate enzymatic reactions in the body (Higdon 2013b). Zinc deficiency is  common in untreated celiac disease, and this deficiency is not always corrected  by a gluten-free diet; zinc supplementation is considered a necessary part of  celiac treatment by some sources (Caruso 2013; Lidums  2015; Kupper 2005). Zinc deficiency may  be a culprit in poor growth, immune function, and wound healing, and skin problems  in celiac disease.</p>
<p>A  review of studies of both untreated and treated celiac patients found a  remarkable prevalence of zinc deficiency, as measured by either plasma or serum  zinc. Eleven separate studies of untreated adults and children with celiac  disease found zinc deficiency in up to 100% of patients. Three of nine studies  of celiac patients on a gluten-free diet for as little as three months to as  long as 10 years found zinc deficiency persisted in 20–40% of patients. On a  gluten-free diet alone, zinc deficiency usually takes a full year to resolve,  and monitoring of serum zinc levels in celiac patients has been suggested (Caruso 2013; Wierdsma 2013; Guevara Pacheco 2014).</p>
<h2>Vitamin E</h2>
<p>Vitamin  E is an important fat-soluble vitamin and free radical scavenger that plays a  major role in protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage (Higdon 2008).  Several studies have reported low levels of vitamin E in individuals with  celiac disease (Odetti 1998; Guevara Pacheco 2014; Henri-Bhargava 2008). Vitamin  E deficiency has also been implicated in the development of neurological  symptoms in celiac disease (Kleopa 2005; Mauro 1991; Battisti 1996;  Henri-Bhargava 2008). Vitamin E supplementation, together with a gluten-free  diet, has been shown to improve neurological impairment caused by vitamin E  deficiency in celiac disease (Kleopa 2005; Henri-Bhargava 2008; Mauro 1991). </p>
<h2>Vitamin A</h2>
<p> Vitamin  A is a fat-soluble nutrient that can become deficient in celiac disease patients  as a result of malabsorption. Vitamin A is important for normal immune  function, vision, and gene expression (Higdon 2007a). The treatment for vitamin  A deficiency in celiac disease is both a gluten-free diet and supplementation (Lidums 2015). One study of newly diagnosed  celiac patients found that 7.5% of them were deficient in vitamin A versus none  in a healthy control group (Wierdsma 2013).  A case study reaffirmed the importance of vitamin A, even in controlled celiac  cases. A 64-year-old man, with biopsy-proven celiac disease controlled on a  gluten-free diet, presented with recent onset of diarrhea as well as redness  and blurring in one eye. During three weeks of treatment of his eye symptoms  with medication, his condition deteriorated. Testing of vitamin A revealed a  stark deficiency. The patient received an intramuscular injection containing  100 000 IU vitamin A, and dramatic improvement in vision and the condition of  his eye was noted within a week. This patient’s follow-up included regular  vitamin A treatment (Alwitry 2000).</p>
<h2>Vitamin K</h2>
<p>Vitamin  K is another fat soluble vitamin that can become deficient in celiac disease as  a result of malabsorption (Lidums 2015; Mager  2012; Kelly  2014; Lidums 2015). Vitamin K deficiency can contribute to  easy bruising, an atypical sign of celiac disease; vitamin K deficiency has  also been shown to increase risk of blood clots and bleeding events in  individuals with celiac disease (Berthoux 2011;  Chen 2007; Vaynshtein 2004; Lerner 2014; Lerner 2014; Chen 2007; Vaynshtein 2004). In a 2012 study in children and  adolescents with celiac disease, dietary intake of vitamin K was assessed. At  diagnosis, 41% of patients had intakes less than half of the recommended  amount, while intake remained deficient in 31% of patients after one year on a  gluten-free diet (Mager 2012). </p>
<p>Children  with both symptomatic and asymptomatic celiac disease have been found to have  reduced bone mass at diagnosis (Mager 2012; Turner 2009; Rajani 2010). Vitamin  K enhances calcium metabolism and therefore plays an important role in bone  health (Zittermann 2001; Booth 2009).  Because dietary intake of calcium and vitamins K and D is often inadequate,  including for patients on a gluten-free diet, routine supplementation with  vitamin K at the time of diagnosis of celiac disease has been suggested (Mager  2012).<strong>  </strong></p>
<h2>Selenium</h2>
<p>Selenium  is an integral part of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which plays a major  role in cellular antioxidant defense (Higdon 2007b). In a study of 30 children  with celiac disease, 80% had serum selenium levels below the normal range (Yuce  2004). Selenium is essential for thyroid hormone regulation, and selenium  deficiency in celiac disease has been linked to an increased risk of autoimmune  thyroid disease (Stazi 2008; Stazi 2010).</p>
<h2>Probiotics</h2>
<p>Probiotics  are beneficial microorganisms that colonize the intestine and play an important  role in intestinal health; the balance of these organisms appears to be  deranged in patients with celiac disease (Pozo-Rubio 2012; Round 2009). In a  three-week randomized controlled trial, supplementation with <em>Bifidobacterium infantis </em>NLS super  strainin untreated celiac disease  patients resulted in improvements in indigestion, constipation, and acid reflux  (Smecuol 2013).</p>
<p>Various  strains of probiotics are being developed to specifically target mechanisms of  immune and intestinal damage in celiac disease. The probiotic strain <em>Bifidobacterium lactis</em> has been shown to  protect cultured gut epithelial cells from damage induced by gluten, possibly  by blocking gluten-induced increases in intestinal permeability (Lindfors  2008). Also, in a lab experiment, a blend of eight different strains of  probiotic bacteria, including several <em>Lactobacillus</em> and <em>Bifidobacterium</em> species, was  demonstrated to extensively pre-digest gluten proteins in wheat flour. When  intestinal biopsy samples from celiac patients were exposed to these  pre-digested gluten proteins, recruitment of immune cells was reduced. Researchers  concluded that the probiotic formulation reduced or eliminated the toxicity of  wheat gluten (De Angelis 2006). </p>
<h2>L-Carnitine</h2>
<p>L-carnitine  is a compound made in the human body from the amino acids lysine and methionine  and also obtained in our diet primarily from animal foods such as meat, fish,  and dairy (Higdon 2012a).  </p>
<p>In  a randomized controlled trial, supplementation with 2 g L-carnitine daily for  six months resulted in significant improvement in reported fatigue in adults  with celiac disease. The L-carnitine dosage was safe and well tolerated (Ciacci  2007).<br>
  <br>
  L-carnitine  is required to shuttle long chain fatty acids into the mitochondria (power  plants of the cell) for muscle energy production. The intestinal damage in  celiac disease results in a decrease in absorptive surface area, increasing  risk of L-carnitine deficiency. In one study, untreated celiac patients were  found to have low serum L-carnitine concentrations, which returned to normal  with a gluten-free diet (Lerner 1993). Another study found low serum carnitine  levels in children with celiac disease (Yuce 2004). L-carnitine deficiency may  produce fatigue, weakness, and difficulty gaining weight, all common symptoms  in celiac disease (Lerner 1993; Guandalini 2014).</p>
<h2>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</h2>
<p>Omega-3  fatty acids have important biological anti-inflammatory effects (Skulas-Ray 2015; Yan 2013; Calder 2015). When  ingested through food or supplements, omega-3 fatty acids compete with the more  pro-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid for incorporation into  lipid-rich cell membranes (Westphal 2011; Calder 2007; Pischon 2003; Surette 2008).</p>
<p>A  study of serum fatty acid composition in adults with newly diagnosed celiac  disease found that concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids were significantly  lower than those of a control group. After one year on a gluten-free diet and  having achieved clinical remission, levels of omega-3 fatty acids increased but  still remained well below control values (Solakivi 2009). A study in children  with celiac disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus found their omega-3 fatty acid  levels—including docosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)—were  significantly lower than those in a control group (Tarnok 2015).  </p>
<p>A  study that used cultures of intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes) supports  the potential benefit of oral supplementation with DHA in reducing intestinal  inflammation in celiac disease. In response to inflammation triggered by  gluten, enterocytes release arachidonic acid. DHA was shown to block this  release of arachidonic acid and the resulting inflammatory cascade that  furthers disease development (Vincentini 2011; Ferretti  2012). Another mechanism by which omega-3 fatty acids reduce  inflammation is through inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-ĸB), a  pro-inflammatory mediator (Lee 2009). DHA also stimulates a cellular receptor  called PPAR-gamma, which activates genes that lessen the production of  pro-inflammatory cytokines (Zapata-Gonzalez 2008). </p>
<h2>Vitamin C</h2>
<p>Vitamin  C is a water-soluble free radical scavenger that is also essential to the  structural integrity of tissues throughout the body (Higdon 2013c). In one  experiment, cultured intestinal biopsies from celiac patients were challenged  with the gliadin component of gluten with and without the addition of vitamin  C. The addition of vitamin C to the cultured cells decreased the secretion of  pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and interferon-gamma. Vitamin C also  completely inhibited the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-15,  which is strongly implicated in the damage that occurs in celiac disease  (Bernardo 2012; Gujral 2012). </p>
<h2>Glutathione</h2>
<p>Glutathione  is one of the body’s most powerful defenses against destructive free radicals,  and is essential to the liver’s detoxification functions (NLM 2015; Kidd 1997). Several studies have reported  significant reductions in glutathione concentrations in the intestinal lining  (Stojiljkovic 2009; Stojiljkovic 2012) and peripheral blood (Stojiljkovic 2007;  Stojiljkovic 2012) of celiac patients compared with controls. As a result,  concentrations of lipid peroxides, or rancid fat, in the intestinal lining  increased. Lipid peroxides can promote a cascade of oxidative damage in  tissues, contributing to the tissue damage in the intestine that is  characteristic of celiac disease, and to the increased risk of cancer in celiac  patients (Stojiljkovic 2007; Stojiljkovic 2009; Stojiljkovic 2012).</p>
<p>The  body’s glutathione reserves can be increased by means of direct supplementation  with glutathione (Richie 2014) or with  the use of physiologic precursors such as cysteine (Lee 2013; Sekhar 2011) and N-acetyl cysteine (NLM 2015; Kidd 1997), as well as with alpha-lipoic acid,  selenium, and whey protein (Chen 2011; Zavorsky 2007; Jiang 2012).</p>
<h2>Pancreatic Enzymes </h2>
<p>Exocrine  pancreatic insufficiency, a condition in which not enough digestive enzymes are  secreted into the small intestine (Toouli 2010), is relatively common in celiac  disease patients who do not respond to a gluten-free diet (Ferri 2015). Damage to the small intestine may  inhibit the ability of the pancreas to secrete digestive enzymes. One study  found that in cases in which diarrhea persisted even after a gluten-free diet,  there was a significantly higher prevalence of laboratory signs of pancreatic  insufficiency. Patients treated with pancreatic enzymes experienced a 75%  reduction in symptoms. Another study found that the severity of villous atrophy  in the small intestine was significantly associated with laboratory signs of  pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Pancreatic enzyme insufficiency was found to  occur in over half of celiac patients in one study, and to return to normal  after one year on a gluten-free diet (Malterre  2009; Evans 2010; Weizman 1987; Regan 1980).</p>
<h2>Additional Support</h2>
<p>The  following interventions have not been thoroughly studied in the context of  celiac disease, but may nonetheless be of benefit by helping support intestinal  health or combatting inflammatory responses or cellular metabolic derangements,  which are thought to underlie several manifestations of celiac disease.</p>
<p><strong>Curcumin. </strong>Curcumin is the principal polyphenolic  compound in turmeric, a plant used in Indian Ayurvedic medicine for centuries  (Higdon 2009). Curcumin has powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant  properties and has demonstrated in laboratory, animal, and human models an  ability to protect against a wide range of conditions including autoimmune  disease and IBD (Gupta 2013; Aggarwal 2009; Brumatti 2014; Bright 2007).  </p>
<p>Like  Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, celiac disease is an inflammatory  autoimmune disorder (Ferri 2015). In  celiac disease, the inflammatory mediator interferon-gamma promotes enhanced  permeability and damage in the small intestine (DiRaimondo 2012; Nilsen 1998).  Curcumin has been shown to suppress interferon-gamma, suggesting that curcumin  may be beneficial in celiac disease (Fahey 2007).</p>
<p>Interestingly,  curcumin may be able to ameliorate psychological manifestations of celiac  disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity as well. In a randomized controlled  trial, a highly bioavailable form of curcumin called BCM-95 was found to be as  effective as the standard antidepressant medication fluoxetine (Prozac) in the  treatment of major depressive disorder (Sanmukhani 2014; Antony 2008). Since  depression and other psychological manifestations of celiac disease and non-celiac  gluten sensitivity are being recognized with increasing frequency (Peters 2014;  Smith 2012; Bushara 2005; Carta 2002; Corvaglia 1999; Addolorato 1996), this is  another of curcumin’s benefits that may be valuable in these gluten-related  disorders. </p>
<p><strong>Alpha-lipoic acid. </strong>Alpha-lipoic acid is a naturally  occurring compound centrally involved in energy production within the  mitochondria of the cell. It is also a powerful free radical scavenger (Higdon  2012b). In addition, alpha-lipoic acid regenerates other free radical  scavengers such as glutathione, vitamin C, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10  (Chen 2011; Packer 2011; Jones 2002). </p>
<p>Alpha-lipoic  acid’s ability to increase levels of glutathione is important in celiac  disease, in which low glutathione levels are common (Stojiljkovic 2007;  Stojiljkovic 2009; Stojiljkovic 2012). In an animal model, dietary  supplementation with alpha-lipoic acid significantly increased both cellular  glutathione concentrations and the activity of glutathione peroxidase, a key  glutathione-dependent antioxidant enzyme. Compared with controls, levels of  oxidized lipids (peroxidation) were significantly lower as well (Chen 2011).  Other studies support alpha-lipoic acid’s potential to accelerate glutathione  synthesis (Packer 2011; Kolgazi 2007; Suh 2004). In a rodent model of gut inflammation,  a feature of celiac disease, treatment of rats with alpha-lipoic acid markedly  reduced several measures of damage to the gut lining (Kolgazi 2007).</p>
<p><strong><em>Boswellia  serrata</em></strong><strong>. </strong>In recent years, preparations from the gummy resin of <em>Boswellia serrata</em> and other boswellia  species have become popular in parts of Europe for the treatment of various  chronic inflammatory conditions including chronic bowel diseases. Clinical  studies suggest boswellia is safe and effective in the treatment of autoimmune  bowel diseases (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis). Boswellic acids, which  are active constituents of boswellia, exert anti-inflammatory effects through  inhibition of proinflammatory pathways involving 5-lipoxygenase, leukotrienes,  and TNF-α (Ammon 2006). In a similar manner, boswellia may help reduce the  intestinal inflammation of celiac disease. </p>
<p><strong>Green tea extract (EGCG). </strong>Animal studies have indicated that green  tea extract and its chief constituent, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), are  capable of interrupting inflammatory tissue damage that contributes to the  symptoms of celiac and other autoimmune disease. Helper T cells are key drivers  in many autoimmune diseases including celiac disease (Monteleone 2001). One mechanism for the protective effect of EGCG is  suppression of autoreactive T cells and reduced production of pro-inflammatory  cytokines. EGCG was also shown to inhibit interferon-gamma, a dominant  inflammatory mediator in celiac disease (Wu 2012).</p>
<p>In  a human cell-line study, EGCG prevented interferon-gamma from increasing  intestinal permeability (Watson 2004). In an animal model of colitis, green tea  extract significantly diminished damage to the colon, as evidenced by reduced  amounts of inflammatory markers, less diarrhea, and slowing of weight loss  (Mazzon 2005).</p>
<p><strong>Glutamine. </strong>Glutamine, an amino  acid, is especially important for the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly  during stress and illness. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the  body, and a critical fuel for the cells lining the intestine. In fact, oral  glutamine supplementation is capable of increasing the height of intestinal  villi, helping the cells of the gut lining to proliferate, and maintaining  integrity of the gut lining and preventing excessive permeability (de Vasconcelos 1998; Miller 1999). As a  regulator of tight junction proteins that “glue” intestinal cells together (Li  2004), glutamine has been shown to exert a positive effect on gut barrier  function (permeability) in a variety of clinical conditions (Beutheu 2013;  Sevastiadou 2011; Choi 2007). In a 2012 randomized controlled trial in patients  with Crohn’s disease in remission phase, oral glutamine administered at 0.23 g  per pound body weight for two months significantly improved intestinal  permeability and mucosal integrity (Benjamin 2012). </p>
<p>Glutamine  supplementation has yet to be studied in celiac disease. However, since  supplementation with glutamine has been demonstrated to safely enhance and  maintain gut barrier function, its application in the increased permeability  caused by celiac disease is an area of great scientific interest (Kuhn 2010; Beutheu 2013; Choi 2007; Benjamin  2012; Fasano 2011; Clemente 2003; Fasano 2005; Arrieta 2006).</p>
<p><strong>Whey protein. </strong>Glutathione forms an integral part of the  defense mechanisms that protect the intestinal mucosa (gut lining) from  oxidative damage (Stojiljkovic 2009). Whey protein is a rich source of cysteine  that is needed for the synthesis of glutathione (Alt  Med Rev 2008). Several studies have shown that whey protein is highly  effective for increasing glutathione levels in various types of cells (Zavorsky  2007; Vilela 2006; Kent 2003; Grey 2003; Middleton 2004). Additionally, in a  2012 study in patients with Crohn’s disease, whey protein significantly reduced  intestinal permeability (Benjamin 2012). This benefit of whey on gut integrity  may be useful in celiac disease, and whey protein can easily be incorporated  into a gluten-free diet as a source of high-quality protein and glutathione  precursors.  </p>
<p><strong>Zinc-carnosine. </strong>Zinc-carnosine, a free radical scavenger  and anti-glycation agent, is composed of zinc and carnosine (Alhamdani 2007). In a randomized crossover  trial, healthy participants were given either zinc-carnosine or placebo after  five days of indomethacin (Indocin) treatment. The indomethacin caused a 3-fold  increase in gut permeability in the placebo group, while zinc-carnosine  prevented this rise in permeability in the treatment group. Although more  studies are needed, zinc-carnosine appears to help maintain the integrity of  the gut barrier (Mahmood 2007).</p>

"<div><a id=""targeted"" name=""targeted""></a>
<p>In addition to the natural therapies listed below, which have been studied in the context of sinusitis, those with acute sinusitis should refer to the <a href=""/protocols/infections/common_cold_01.htm"">Common Cold</a> protocol, since a majority of sinusitis cases arise from complications of the common cold (Puhakka 1998; Han 2011; NIH 2012).</p>
<p><strong>Lactoferrin</strong> – Lactoferrin and its active metabolite, lactoferricin, are multifunctional proteins known to possess antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities, as well as immune regulatory and anti-inflammatory actions (Psaltis 2008). Lactoferrin is a component of whey protein that can also be found in high concentrations within mucosal secretions, such as airway mucus, tears, and breast milk (Roxas 2007; Acioglu 2012). Lactoferrin is produced and stored within the cells of the nasal mucosa and is presumed important as a first line of defense against invading pathogens (Acioglu 2012). </p>
<p>Research suggests that lactoferrin may be beneficial for alleviating the symptoms and complications of the common cold for at least 2 reasons. First, it can kill bacteria through the binding of iron molecules that would otherwise be needed for essential bacterial functions (Acioglu 2012; Roxas 2007). Second, lactoferrin exerts an antioxidant effect by preventing the formation of free radicals, thus decreasing nasal tissue oxidative damage (Acioglu 2012). </p>
<p>Studies suggest that decreased levels of lactoferrin may play a role in the development of chronic sinusitis, especially when nasal polyps, asthma, and/or allergies are involved (Zielinska-Blizniewska 2012; Psaltis 2008). Lactoferrin production is reduced in people with sinus conditions compared to healthy subjects. Moreover, lactoferrin levels are particularly low in sinusitis patients with nasal polyps. The low levels of lactoferrin associated with sinusitis are due to both its decreased expression/down-regulation as well as its increased utilization to fight infection (Acioglu 2012).</p>
<p><strong>Vitamin C</strong> - Since the human body cannot synthesize vitamin C, it must be acquired from the diet (Hemavathi 2010). Research shows a sufficient daily intake of ascorbic acid is required for the immune system to defend the body against infections (especially viral infections) (Ely 2007).</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that supplementation with 1000 mg daily of vitamin C can decrease the risk of catching a cold (Holt 2010). When given in doses greater than 200 mg daily, vitamin C has been shown to reduce the duration of cold symptoms by 1-4 days (Khalid 2011). Vitamin C markedly improves immune function by enhancing natural killer cell activity, interferons (signaling proteins that boost immune response), macrophages, T-lymphocyte production, cell movement (ie, chemotaxis), and cell-mediated immunity (Heimer 2009; Khalid 2011).</p>
<p>Individuals with sinusitis typically exhibit decreased serum levels of vitamin C (Cho 2009; Unal 2004). Topical vitamin C may be associated with enhanced mucociliary clearance of the paranasal sinuses, through the loosening of thick mucus secretions, and an increase in ciliary beat frequency (Cho 2009; Zhang 2012). Oral vitamin C supplementation also reliably decreases plasma levels of histamine, a known contributor to inflammation and nasal congestion, especially among people with allergy-induced sinusitis (Helms 2006; Naclerio 2010).</p>
<p><strong>Zinc</strong> –<strong> </strong>Zinc is an essential trace element required for a variety of metabolic processes (Classen 2011), including the maintenance of a healthy immune function (Roxas 2007). Unfortunately, zinc deficiency is prevalent throughout developed Western countries (Maggini 2012). Zinc deficiency, which is common among the elderly and the young, is linked to the impairment of many components of the immune response, including T- and B-lymphocyte function, natural killer cell activity, macrophage phagocytosis, and antibody formation (Maggini 2012; Pae 2012; Nriagu 2007). As a result, zinc deficiency is associated with an increased risk of infection (Maggini 2012; Pae 2012). In one study, children with chronic rhinosinusitis exhibited lower levels of antioxidants, including zinc, than healthy control subjects (Unal 2004). Correcting zinc deficiency through supplementation is efficacious for a variety of viral infections (Pae 2012; Nriagu 2007). This may be partly attributable to zinc’s positive effect on the expression of interleukin-2 and interferon-γ, as well as on natural killer and cytotoxic T cells, which help the immune system kill viruses (Sandstead 2010). </p>
<p>Zinc supplementation has long been considered an effective therapy for reducing the duration of the common cold (Roxas 2007; Nriagu 2007). A 2011 study concluded that zinc supplementation significantly reduced both duration and severity of the common cold when administered within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. This study also revealed that zinc supplementation over 5 months was helpful for preventing infection by common cold viruses (Singh 2011). Likewise, a clinical study involving zinc nasal gel (given within 1-2 days of illness onset) found that zinc was able to reduce the severity and duration of common cold symptoms among healthy adults (Mossad 2003). In a 2012 study, researchers found that the combination of zinc plus vitamin C was more efficacious than placebo at reducing runny nose, and it also appeared to accelerate recovery in common cold patients (Maggini 2012).</p>
<p><strong>N-acetyl cysteine</strong> – N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) may reduce the viscosity and improve the clearance of mucus. NAC has antioxidant properties, which can help protect against free radical damage. It may also help restore healthy sinus conditions that have deteriorated due to sinusitis (Clinical Pharmacology 2012).<br>A 2010 study found that NAC is capable of fighting infections, such as those that cause sinusitis, through its ability to break down biofilms. Biofilms are essentially a community of bacteria that adhere to surfaces, including moist mucus membranes. These biofilms are known to produce resistant communities of bacteria and are estimated to be involved in at least 60% of all chronic and/or recurrent infections. NAC has been shown to reduce the adhesion of biofilms to mucus membranes (eg, antibiotics or nasal steroids) (Pintucci 2010).</p>
<p><strong>Vitamin E</strong> – Numerous studies have demonstrated that vitamin E may have a positive effect on the human immune system. For instance, elderly patients who took 200 IU of vitamin E daily for 1 year were 20% less likely to catch a cold (Burton 2004). In one study, children with chronic rhinosinusitis were found to have lower serum levels of several antioxidants, including vitamin E, than healthy children (Unal 2004). A 2011 study found that topical vitamin E (in combination with other antioxidant oils) was able to persistently reverse oxidative stress and nasal inflammation, similar to that by viral infections, chronic sinusitis, and allergic disease (Gao 2011). Furthermore, animal studies show that vitamin E may affect the risk and severity of viral respiratory infections (Hemila 2006).</p>
<p><strong>Rosmarinic acid</strong> – Rosmarinic acid is an antioxidant compound found in rosemary (Kelsey 2010). In experimental animal models, rosmarinic acid has been shown to reduce allergic inflammatory reactions by decreasing histamine release and inhibiting the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (Oh 2011). This mechanism of action may be significant for individuals suffering from chronic sinusitis caused by allergies.  </p>
<p><strong>Bromelain</strong> – Bromelain, which is a proteolytic enzyme complex found in pineapple, is frequently used to treat sinusitis because it reduces inflammation and loosens mucus. Specifically, bromelain may inhibit pro-inflammatory prostaglandin biosynthesis and prostaglandin E1 accumulation. This in turn inhibits the release of leukocyte enzymes. Among sinusitis patients, bromelain has been shown to hasten symptom recovery and resolve inflammation better than standard treatment or placebo. Typical oral doses of bromelain are between 500-2000 mg daily (Helms 2006).</p>
<p><strong>Eucalyptus</strong> – Cineole is the main ingredient of eucalyptus oil. It has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, and it also affects ciliary beat frequency (Tesche 2008). Studies have confirmed that cineole can thin, drain, and reduce mucus secretions. In a clinical study involving 152 patients with acute rhinosinusitis, cineole was associated with significant symptom improvement at 4 and 7 days when compared to placebo. The authors concluded that cineole is safe and effective for the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis, and suggested that it be utilized prior to the initiation of antibiotics (Kehrl 2004). In 2008, a similar study was conducted among 150 patients with acute and viral rhinosinusitis. These authors also found that treatment with cineole resulted in reduced symptoms at 4 and 7 days, and concluded that this treatment effect was clinically relevant (Tesche 2008).</p>
<p><strong>Herbal combination formula</strong> – A combination of Gentian root, Primula flower, Elder flower, Sorrel herb, and Verbena herb is frequently used in the treatment of acute and chronic rhinosinusitis (Glatthaar-Saalmuller 2011; Rossi 2012). Results from a 2011 laboratory study demonstrated that this formula shows a broad spectrum of antiviral activity against viruses commonly known to cause respiratory infections (Glatthaar-Saalmuller 2011). A more concentrated version of the formula (ie, dry extract) reduced exudate volume and leukocyte numbers in an animal study. It also reduced the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 protein and lowered prostaglandin E2 levels. Therefore, the rationality for using the combination formula to manage sinusitis is partly based on its significant anti-inflammatory effects (Rossi 2012). Since inflammation of the mucosa can often lead to a loss of smell, researchers theorize that this combination of herbs may be useful for this indication as well (Reden 2011).</p>
<p><strong>Xylitol nasal irrigation</strong> – Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that appears to enhance the body’s natural defense against bacterial pathogens. An animal model showed that administering xylitol solution simultaneously with a bacterial pathogen reduced the amount of bacteria detectable upon a later examination of the sinuses (Brown 2004). In one trial, 20 subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis were randomized and instructed to rinse their sinuses daily with either a xylitol or saline solution. Fifteen subjects completed the study. Nasal irrigation with the xylitol solution was associated with a significant improvement on a standardized assessment of sinusitis symptoms (Weissman 2011). Another trial designed to assess the effects of xylitol nasal irrigation compared to placebo in the treatment of chronic sinusitis is recruiting participants as of November 2012 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00924404).</p>
<p><strong>Black cumin seed oil </strong>– Nigella sativa, also known as black cumin, is a flowering plant that grows in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Western Asia. The small black seeds of nigella sativa have a rich history of medical use in the Middle East and Asian countries. Modern scientific inquiry has examined the potential benefit of black cumin seeds and the oil derived from them in a variety of contexts ranging from cardiovascular disease to cancer (Shabana 2012; Randhawa 2011; Woo 2012; Butt 2010). Several lines of evidence suggest that black cumin seed oil and some of its active constituents are powerful anti-inflammatory agents and also combat oxidative stress (Inci 2012; Umar 2012; Ammar el 2011). In an animal model of rhinosinusitis, an active constituent derived from black cumin seed was found to be as effective as antibiotic therapy in reducing manifestations of sinusitis such as vascular congestion, inflammation, and epithelial injury in sinus tissue (Cingi 2011). <strong></strong></p></div>",https://www.lifeextension.com/Protocols/Respiratory/Sinusitis/Page-06

  <h2> How Can I Prepare for Surgery and Speed Recovery?
  </h2>
<p>
    Almost 50 million inpatient surgeries are performed each year in the United
    States. Modern advances have made surgeries faster, more precise, and much
    safer. Of course, there are still risks associated with any surgery,
    including infection, pain, and complications from anesthesia.
</p>
<p>
    Recently, several strategies have been identified that patients and their
    medical teams can utilize to promote faster recovery times and improve
    patient health.
</p>
<p>
Also, many natural integrative interventions such as<strong> omega-3 fatty acids</strong>, <strong>coenzyme Q10</strong>, and    <strong>vitamins C, D, and E</strong> have been shown to improve patient
    health both pre- and postoperatively.
</p>
<h2> What is Important During the Preoperative Period?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Risk assessment – the surgical team will determine the patient’s risk of
    complications and what steps to take to prevent them. </li>
  <li> Nutritional interventions to ensure the patient has adequate reserves of
    carbohydrates, proteins, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals </li>
  <li> Preoperative fasting to reduce the risk of complications due to
    anesthesia </li>
  <li> Premedication to prevent blood clots, if deemed necessary </li>
  <li> Premedication with antibiotics, if deemed necessary </li>
  <li> Lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking or exercising to improve
    outcomes </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What is Important During the Postoperative (Recovery) Period?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Pain management, either through medication or non-medicinal interventions
    like massages </li>
  <li> Wound healing – proper levels of oxygen and nutrients are essential for
    healing wounds. </li>
  <li> Preventing infection, potentially with antibiotics </li>
  <li> Food and fluid intake is necessary for recovery. Patients should focus on
    food and supplements to boost their immune system and promote healing (see
    “What Natural Interventions are Beneficial for Surgery Recovery?”). </li>
  <li> Physical activity as soon as possible after surgery </li>
  </ul>
  
  
    <h2>
      What Emerging Strategies Appear Promising For Improving Surgery
      Outcomes?
    </h2>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Using natural openings instead of incisions to reach the area of surgery
  </li>
  <li>
    Decreased size and number of incisions (eg, laparoscopic surgery)
  </li>
  <li>
    Robotic surgeries
  </li>
  <li>
    Advances in creating artificial materials and body parts like 3-D
    printing
  </li>
</ul>

  <h2> 
    What Natural Interventions are Beneficial for Surgery Recovery?
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Immunonutrition shakes.</strong>
      Several immunonutrition shakes and supplements are commercially
      available and can reduce the risk of infection and shorten hospital
      stay. Most effective supplements contain omega-3 fatty acids, proteins
      and amino acids, and a variety of vitamins and minerals.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Vitamin C.</strong>
      Vitamin C is important for wound healing, reducing the incidence of
      atrial fibrillation, and reducing markers of oxidative stress. The
      combination of intravenous vitamin C with thiamin (vitamin B1) and
      hydrocortisone has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of death
      from sepsis.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Vitamin E. </strong>
      Vitamin E can improve wound healing, reduce tissue damage caused by
      free radicals, and lessen surgically-induced inflammation.        <strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Vitamin D. </strong>
      Vitamin D is critical for bone health and can improve patient outcome
      in certain surgeries including knee replacement and hip fractures.        <strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Omega-3 fatty acids. </strong>
      Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of infection and other
      complications, shorten hospital stays, and improve the nutritional
      status of postoperative patients. <strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). </strong>
      CoQ10 is an antioxidant that may reduce inflammation due to various
      surgeries.<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Zinc. </strong>
      Zinc is an important cofactor for several enzymes involved in wound
      healing.<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Propolis. </strong>
      Propolis, a<strong> </strong>resin produced by honey bees, has
      antimicrobial properties that may help heal wounds.<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li> Many other natural interventions may be beneficial to those undergoing surgery, including <strong>melatonin</strong>, <strong>curcumin</strong>, <strong>alpha-lipoic acid</strong>, <strong>probiotics</strong>, <strong>N-acetyl cysteine</strong>, and others.

  <h2> Improving Wound Healing and Trauma Recovery
  </h2>
<p>
    The body undergoes profound physiological responses to injury and physical
    trauma. Injuries may be accidental or intentional (as with surgery), but
    all wound healing is complex with multiple stages. Much ongoing research is
    actively seeking improved methods to treat wounds.
</p>
<p>
    Wound treatment always involves promoting the closing of the injury, as
    well as preventing infection. Also, maintaining good nutrition is critical
    during the wound healing process because several nutrients are critical to
    this process.
</p>
<p>
Many natural integrative interventions such as <strong>whey protein</strong>, <strong>omega-3 fatty acids</strong>,    <strong>trace elements</strong>, and <strong>vitamins </strong>may be
    useful in supporting successful wound healing.
</p>
<h2> What Factors Can Compromise Wound Healing?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Infection
  </li>
  <li>
    Foreign bodies in the wound
  </li>

    Alcohol and smoking
  </li>
  <li>
    Poor nutrition
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> How are Wounds and Trauma Conventionally Treated?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Debridement ‒ the removal of foreign debris and/or dead tissue from the
    wound </li>
  <li> Infection control, including oral and/or topical antibiotics </li>
  <li> Wound closure with staples, sutures, or adhesives </li>
  <li> Dressings to keep the wound in a moist environment ideal for healing </li>
  <li> Mechanical offloading to remove pressure from the wound (eg, orthotics,
    padding) </li>
  <li>
    Parenteral or enteral nutrition
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> What Emerging Strategies May Improve Wound Healing?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Wound biomarkers and diagnostics
  </li>

    attack bacteria), antimicrobial peptides, and wound dressings containing
    chitosan </li>
  <li> Other interventions, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy,
    negative-pressure wound therapy, cryopreserved placental membrane, and
    ultrasound or electrical stimulation to stimulate cells </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Can Improve Trauma and Wound
  Healing?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Eating enough calories to support healing
  </li>
  
  <ul>
  <li> Caloric needs during wound healing are estimated to be 30–35 kcal/kg of
    body weight, or up to 40 kcal/kg for an underweight patient. </li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>
     Eating enough protein to meet the demand for amino acids required for
    cell growth and tissue repair
  </li>
  
  <ul>
  <li> The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recommends protein intake
    of 1.25 to 1.5 g/kg of body weight per day for patients with healing
    wounds. </li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>
    Proper hydration
  </li>
  <li> Exercise, to the level appropriate to the patient’s physical condition </li>
  <li>
    Quitting smoking
  </li>
</ul>

        wound-healing process.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Vitamin A</strong>. Topical vitamin A can stimulate growth of cells involved in tissue
        and skin repair.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Vitamin C</strong>. Low vitamin C levels are associated with delayed wound healing.
        Vitamin C can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, and is a
        cofactor for collagen synthesis.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Diosmin and hesperidin</strong>. Diosmin and hesperidin are citrus flavonoids that have been studied
        for their effects on venous insufficiency, including healing venous
        ulcers.
    </li>

  <h2> What is Scleroderma?
  </h2>
<p>
    The term “scleroderma” refers to a group of related conditions primarily
    characterized by similar manifestations. Fibrosis (excessive connective
    tissue formation, almost always resulting in hardening of the skin),
    vascular damage, and autoimmune responses are all common in scleroderma.
    The cause of scleroderma is not well understood, and there are no drugs to
    cure the underlying condition.
</p>
<p>
    Scleroderma can either be localized or systemic. Systemic scleroderma, also
    called systemic sclerosis, is much more severe; it can cause damage to
    internal organs unlike the localized condition.
</p>
<p>
    Several natural interventions such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) from
    green tea and N-acetylcysteine may be helpful for addressing the driving
    factors behind the disease’s progression.
</p>
<h2> What are the Risk Factors for Scleroderma?
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Genetic predisposition
    </li>
    <li>
        Exposure to some industrial chemicals
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: The exact cause of scleroderma is unknown. </p>
<h2> What are the Signs and Symptoms of Scleroderma?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Skin changes, including hardening, swelling, and abnormal lightening or
    darkening </li>
  <li> Raynaud’s phenomenon, in which cold temperature or stress causes
    vasoconstriction. The affected limb(s) or digit(s) usually turn white with
    lack of blood flow, then blue with poor oxygenation, and then red when
    blood flow resumes. </li>
  <li> Systemic sclerosis can cause other symptoms involving internal
    organs—coughing due to lung involvement, arrhythmia due to heart
    involvement, digestive problems, or scleroderma renal crisis if kidneys are
    affected. </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are Conventional Medical Treatments for Scleroderma?
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: There is no known cure for scleroderma. Conventional treatments generally
    are palliative and aim to alleviate symptoms and reduce complications. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Drugs to improve blood flow for Raynaud’s phenomenon </li>
  <li> Immunomodulatory or suppressing drugs for skin or lung fibrosis </li>
  <li> Antacids or drugs that reduce stomach acid for digestive problems </li>
  <li> Dialysis or blood pressure lowering drugs for renal crisis </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are New Research Directions for Treating Scleroderma?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Studying epigenetic or other methods to reduce proliferation and/or
    activation of fibroblasts <strong></strong>
  </li>
  <li> Drugs that destroy immune B cells or inhibit their production <strong></strong>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Can Help Manage Scleroderma?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
     Avoid cold temperatures and emotional stress to reduce Raynaud’s
    phenomenon attacks.
  </li>
  <li> Exercise to enhance blood circulation and improve endothelial function. </li>
  <li> Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables to avoid malnutrition and
    reduce oxidative stress. </li>
</ul>
<h2> What Natural Interventions Can Help Manage Scleroderma?
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA)</strong>. GLA, an omega-6 fatty acid found in evening primrose oil, can reduce
        episodes of Raynaud’s phenomenon. It also may diminish pain and improve
        skin texture in those with scleroderma.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe)</strong>. SAMe has many uses, and in scleroderma patients it has been shown to
        improve skin quality.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>N-acetylcysteine (NAC)</strong>. NAC can reduce the severity of Raynaud’s phenomenon, diminish
        lung-related complications of scleroderma, and improve vascular
        function of the liver and kidneys.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Vitamin E</strong>. Vitamin E can be helpful in several autoimmune disorders, including
        scleroderma. Several symptoms of scleroderma have been reported to
        respond well to vitamin E.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Green tea</strong>. Green tea and one of its active constituents,        <strong>epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)</strong>, have beneficial
        effects on the endothelium. Evidence suggests EGCG suppresses tissue
        fibrosis.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Gotu kola</strong>. Gotu kola is an herb that has many skin-healing properties. In one
        study, patients treated with gotu kola saw improvements in skin
        quality, vascular health, and general condition.
    </li>
    <li>
Other natural interventions such as <strong>curcumin</strong>,<strong> 4-aminobenzoic acid</strong>,<strong> vitamin D</strong>, and        <strong>melatonin </strong>may be beneficial to patients with
        scleroderma.

"<div><a id=""introduction"" name=""introduction""></a><p>Fungal infections are estimated to occur in over a billion people each year, and recent evidence suggests the rate is increasing (Hsu 2011; Di Santo 2010; Brown 2012; Fungal Research Trust 2011). Fungi can infect almost any part of the body including skin, nails, respiratory tract, urogenital tract, alimentary tract, or can be systemic (Long 2009; Baron 1996). Anyone can acquire a fungal infection, but the elderly, critically ill, and individuals with weakened immunity, due to diseases such as HIV/AIDS or use of immunosuppressive medications, have a higher risk (Hsu 2011; Baddley 2011).</p>
<p>Although several species of fungi are potentially pathogenic in humans, <strong>candida </strong>(esp. <em>Candida albicans</em>) is the organism responsible for most fungal infections. Candida, which is normally present within the human body, is usually harmless. However, it can cause symptoms when a weakened immune system or other factors allow it to grow unabated (Merck Manual 2008; Cheng 2012; Douglas 2011).</p>
<p>Increased use of antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids are major factors contributing to higher frequency of fungal infections. Antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs, by disrupting normal bacterial colonization and suppressing the immune system, create an environment within the body in which fungi can thrive (Hsu 2011; Tani 2012).</p>
<p>Fungal infections can range in severity from superficial to life-threatening. For example, fungal infections affecting only the top layers of the skin are readily treatable and have a relatively limited impact on quality of life. However, if a fungal infection enters systemic circulation, consequences can be deadly (Badiee 2011; Zuber 2001). </p>
<p>Many integrative medical practitioners believe that chronic, low-level candida infestation can cause a variety of non-specific symptoms that may resemble chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, anxiety, or fibromyalgia. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as “candida-related complex”. Conventional medical practitioners do not recognize candida-related complex as a disease. However, many innovative healthcare practitioners report improvements in patient quality of life upon treatment (Gaby 2011).</p>
<p>Upon reading this protocol, you will have a better understanding of the various ways that fungi can infect a human host, and how conventional medicine treats these infections. In addition, you will discover several natural compounds that have anti-fungal activity and may complement conventional treatments for fungal infections.</p></div>",https://www.lifeextension.com/Protocols/Infections/Fungal-Infections-Candida/Page-01

  <h2> What are Cataracts?
  </h2>
<p>
    Cataracts are opacities that form in the lens of the eye, causing visual
    obstruction. They arise when proteins in the eye form aggregates due to
    incorrect three-dimensional structure. There are several factors that cause
    proteins to aggregate, including oxidative stress and glycation. Cataracts
    are the most common cause of blindness and are generally treated with
    surgery.
</p>
<p>
    The formation of cataracts is associated with diabetes, but many people may
    not be aware that higher-than-normal blood glucose levels, even if not
    clinically considered diabetes, can contribute to cataracts.
</p>
<p>
Natural interventions including antioxidants such as    <strong>vitamin C</strong> and <strong>riboflavin</strong>, as well as
glycation inhibitors such as <strong>carnosine</strong> and    <strong>carnitine</strong>, may help reduce the risk of cataract formation.
</p>
<h2> What are the Risk Factors for Cataracts?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Age
  </li>
  <li> Gender – women are more likely to develop cataracts </li>
  <li>
    Poor nutrition
  </li>
  <li>
    Diabetes
  </li>
  <li> Exposure to ionizing radiation such as X-rays or UV rays </li>
  <li>
    Smoking and drinking alcohol
  </li>
  <li>
    Genetic predisposition
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are the Signs and Symptoms of Cataracts?
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: Depending on the type of cataract, the symptoms can vary. Some common
    symptoms of the different types of cataracts include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Seeing double or multiple images
    </li>
    <li>
        Difficulty distinguishing colors
    </li>
    <li>
        Glare or halos around lights
    </li>
    <li>
        Impaired ability to see in bright lights
    </li>
</ul>
<h2> How are Cataracts Conventionally Treated?
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Surgery
    </li>
</ul>
<h2> What Emerging Therapies Appear Promising for Cataracts?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Combining non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with surgery </li>
  <li>
    Statins
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What Dietary or Lifestyle Changes Can Help Prevent Cataracts?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Quitting smoking
  </li>
  <li>
     Limiting exposure to UV radiation by wearing sunglasses
  </li>
  <li>
    Limiting alcohol consumption
  </li>
  <li> Increasing intake of fruits and vegetables, as they are natural sources
    of antioxidants </li>
  <li> Avoiding foods high in saturated fats and consuming more omega-3 fatty
    acids </li>
  <li>
    Controlling blood glucose levels
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What Natural Interventions May Be Beneficial for Preventing Cataracts?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Glutathione</strong>. Glutathione scavenges free radicals in the lens, preventing oxidative
    damage to the proteins. </li>
  <li><strong>Vitamin C</strong>. Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant to support healthy proteins in the
    lens and is linked with lower incidence of cataract development. </li>
  <li><strong>Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)</strong>. Riboflavin is an essential component of flavin adenine dinucleotide
    (FAD), which is used by the enzyme that converts glutathione to its
    bioactive form. High riboflavin levels have been associated with
    reduced risk of cataract formation. </li>
  <li><strong>Vitamin B6</strong>. Vitamin B6 has been shown to reduce the production of advanced
    glycation end products (AGEs) in diabetic lenses. </li>
  <li><strong>Vitamin E</strong>. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant and low levels are associated with
    an increased risk of developing cataracts. </li>
  <li> Other antioxidants and glycation inhibitors that can help prevent
    cataracts are <strong>N-acetylcysteine</strong>,<strong>lipoic acid</strong>, <strong>melatonin</strong>,<strong>carnosine</strong>, <strong>carnitine</strong>, and    <strong>quercetin</strong>.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Carotenoids</strong>. Carotenoids (a type of plant pigment) such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and
    meso-zeaxanthin can absorb light and prevent damage caused by UV rays.
    They are found in high concentrations in the eye and can help prevent
    cataract formation. </li>
  <li>
    Other interventions for healthy eyes include <strong>bilberry</strong>,        <strong> green and black tea</strong>, <strong>resveratrol</strong>,
    and <strong>selenium</strong>.

  <h2> What is GERD?
  </h2>
<p>
    Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which stomach
    contents are refluxed back into the esophagus. The disease can often cause
    severe discomfort. Prolonged esophageal exposure to the harsh stomach
    contents and subsequent esophageal damage can also lead to complications
    including esophageal cancer.
</p>
<p>
    Many people do not realize that prolonged use of proton-pump inhibitor
    (PPI) drugs to suppress GERD symptoms can lead to impaired nutrient
    absorption.
</p>
<p>
    Natural integrative interventions like <strong>raft-forming agents</strong>
    and <strong>deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) extract</strong> can offer
    relief for GERD symptoms.
</p>
<h2> What Increases GERD Risk?
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
    Obesity
    </li>

<li>
    Food sensitivities (blood tests to detect antibodies against specific
    foods can be useful for GERD symptoms that fluctuate with diet)
</li>

    <li>
        Smoking
    </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are the Signs and Symptoms of GERD?
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Heartburn
    </li>
    <li>
        Nausea
    </li>

<li>
    Difficulty swallowing and/or “lump” in the throat
</li>

    <li>
        Sleep disturbances
    </li>
    <li>
        Respiratory symptoms such as coughing
    </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are the Conventional Medical Treatments for GERD?
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Antacids to neutralize stomach acid
    </li>

<li>
    Histamine-2 receptor (H2) blockers to prevent secretion of stomach acid
</li>

    <li>
        PPIs to inhibit production of stomach acid
    </li>

<li>
    Gamma-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB) receptor activators to reduce lower
    esophageal sphincter relaxation
</li>
<li>
    Surgery to reconstruct the lower esophageal sphincter mechanism
</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Long-term use of PPIs and other acid-blocking drugs may cause adverse
    effects. PPIs may impair nutrient absorption and lead to deficiencies in
    the body. In one study, chronic use of high doses of PPIs and H2 receptor
    blockers increased the risk of hip fractures significantly.
</p>
<h2> What Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Can Help Relieve GERD?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Avoid foods and beverages associated with GERD symptoms including coffee,
    chocolate, spicy foods, carbonated beverages, and alcohol. </li>
  <li>
    Quit smoking, as it can increase symptoms.
  </li>
  <li> Increased body mass can cause pressure on the stomach, increasing stress
    on the esophageal valve. Obese individuals have shown a 94% increase in
    GERD symptoms over those with body masses in the normal range. Losing
    weight may help alleviate symptoms. </li>
  <li> Reduced fat and carbohydrate intake may help alleviate symptoms. </li>
  <li> Avoid eating close to bedtime and sleep with your head elevated. </li>
  <li> Limit use of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
    (NSAIDs). </li>
</ul>
<h2> What Natural Interventions May Be Beneficial for GERD?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Melatonin</strong>. Melatonin exhibits GI tract protecting abilities and has shown faster
    relief for GERD symptoms than a commonly-used PPI.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Raft-forming agents</strong>. These agents combine gel-forming fibers with an antacid to form a
    “raft” to block stomach contents from entering the esophagus.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) extract</strong>. DGL extract can help heal the delicate tissues of the digestive tract
    and has shown effectiveness in treating indigestion.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mineral carbonates</strong>. Calcium and magnesium carbonate, and potassium bicarbonate,
    neutralize stomach acids to decrease irritation of the esophagus. </li>
  <li>
    Increased intake of <strong>fruits and vegetables</strong>, <strong>fiber</strong>, <strong>zinc</strong>,        <strong>vitamins E and C</strong>, <strong>beta carotene</strong>, and
    dietary <strong>folate</strong> are linked with lower risks of
    esophageal cancer.

<p>Diverticula are small pouches or pockets in the wall of the  digestive system, most often the large intestine. When these pouches become  inflamed, this characterizes diverticular disease. Diverticula are quite common  in older individuals, and often do not cause symptoms.</p>
<p>Targeted natural interventions including probiotics, butyrate,  and fiber may help decrease symptoms and improve diverticular disease.</p>
<h2>Figure 1: The Spectrum of Conditions Associated with Diverticula</h2>

<h2>Signs and  Symptoms</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Acute diverticulitis causes pain in the lower left  abdomen that tends to worsen with movement.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Factors currently known to increase risk of  diverticulosis include advancing age, obesity, and smoking.</li>
    <li>Factors known to increase risk of diverticulitis include  low-fiber diet, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and  use of NSAIDs and pain relievers. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Since it is asymptomatic in most people, diverticulosis  is usually found incidentally during an unrelated diagnostic or screening procedure. </li>
    <li>Computed tomography (CT) scan or abdominal  ultrasound are the preferred diagnostic imaging modalities to establish a  diagnosis of diverticular disease.</li>
    <li>Mild cases of uncomplicated diverticular disease  may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conventional Treatment</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Asymptomatic diverticulosis does not require  treatment.</li>
    <li>Conservative treatment for uncomplicated  diverticulitis includes a liquid or low-residue diet and oral antibiotics.</li>
    <li>In complicated diverticulitis, hospitalization  with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, or surgery may be required.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Novel and Emerging Strategies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fecal calprotectin, a non-invasive stool test, is  under investigation as a biomarker that may help identify diverticular disease.</li>
    <li>An analysis of four randomized controlled trials  found rifaximin (Xifaxan), an antibiotic with a favorable safety profile, plus  fiber supplementation was associated with better symptom relief, fewer  complications, and a better chance of being symptom-free after one year  compared with fiber supplementation alone.</li>
    <li>A randomized controlled trial using mesalamine  (Asacol) in patients with acute diverticulitis found the rate of complete  response was significantly higher in patients receiving mesalamine versus  placebo.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dietary and Lifestyle Considerations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Plant-based diets that are high in fiber may protect  against diverticular disease.</li>
    <li>Contrary to popular belief, nut and popcorn  consumption may reduce the risk of diverticulitis rather than increase it.</li>
    <li>Physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight  may reduce the incidence of diverticular disease.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A  low-fiber diet is often recommended during the initial healing phase after an  episode of acute diverticulitis. People recovering from an episode should ask their  healthcare provider about consuming fiber.</p>
<h2>Integrative Interventions</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Probiotics: </strong>By  helping restore the balance of intestinal flora and reduce inflammation in the intestine,  probiotic supplementation may be of benefit in both acute and chronic diverticular  problems.</li>
    <li><strong>Butyrate: </strong>In  a randomized clinical trial of sodium butyrate in 52 people with diverticular disease,  less than 7% of those in the butyrate group experienced diverticulitis symptoms  compared with slightly more than 31% in the placebo group.</li>
    <li><strong>Fiber: </strong>Gradually  increasing fiber until consumption reaches<strong> </strong>20–30 g of fiber daily has been recommended by some diverticular disease  researchers. Supplemental fiber in a form like psyllium seed husk can help  increase total daily fiber intake.</li>
    <li><strong>Fish oil: </strong>Several  university-associated medical centers recommend supplementing omega-3 fatty  acids, including from fish oil, in diverticular disease, as these have  anti-inflammatory activity.</li>
    <li><strong>Curcumin:</strong> Studies  in animal models have shown curcumin can inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha,  one of the inflammatory chemical messengers associated with diverticular  disease and acute diverticulitis.</li>

  <h2> What are Gallstones?
  </h2>
<p>
    Gallstones are hard deposits formed from bile components in the gallbladder
    or bile ducts. Gallstones are most commonly formed when there is an excess
    of cholesterol in the bile, causing it to crystallize. Blockages caused by
    gallstones can cause moderate to severe pain, and can lead to several
    complications, including inflammation of the gallbladder and infection of
    the bile ducts. Gallstones are also linked to increased risk of certain
    cancers and cardiovascular diseases.
</p>
<p>
    For many, gallstone formation is linked with a typical western diet
    consisting of high amounts of cholesterol and saturated fats.
</p>
<p>
Natural integrative interventions like <strong>vitamin C</strong> and    <strong>omega-3 fatty acids</strong> may help reduce the risk of gallstone
    formation.
</p>
<h2> What Increases Gallstone Risk?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> A western diet high in saturated fats and cholesterol and low in fiber is
    one of the strongest risk factors. </li>
  <li>
    Age
  </li>
  <li> Gender – women are more likely than men to develop cholesterol
    gallstones. </li>
  <li> Ethnicity – native North and South Americans and Mexican Americans have a
    higher risk. </li>
  <li>
    Genetic predisposition
  </li>
  <li>
    Obesity
  </li>
  <li> Rapid weight loss, prolonged fasting, and weight cycling </li>
  <li>
    Total parenteral nutrition (TPN, ie, all nutrition is derived
    intravenously)
  </li>
  <li> Medications including female hormones and thiazide diuretics (mainly used
    to treat high blood pressure) </li>
  <li>
    Sedentary lifestyle
  </li>
  <li> Other diseases and conditions such as metabolic syndrome, celiac disease,
    and some liver diseases </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are the Signs and Symptoms of Gallstones?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Biliary pain (acute, severe pain in the upper-right or upper-mid region
    of the abdomen) </li>
  <li> Biliary pain that lasts more than 24 hours and is accompanied by nausea,
    fever, or jaundice can indicate a complication associated with gallstones
    and warrants emergent evaluation. </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What are the Conventional Medical Treatments for Gallstones?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy)
  </li>
  <li>
     Ursodeoxycholic acid may be an alternative to surgery for small,
    cholesterol-rich gallstones, but can take years to completely dissolve
    them.
  </li>
  <li> Other interventions including combination procedures to remove stones
    from the common bile duct, stone fragmentation, and balloon dilation of the
    bile duct opening. </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What Novel and Emerging Therapies Appear Promising for Gallstones?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    The anti-diabetes medication metformin
  </li>
  <li>
     Cholesterol-lowering medications such as statins and ezetimibe (Zetia)
  </li>
  <li> Surgical advances, including natural orifice transluminal endoscopic
    surgery (NOTES) </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Can Help Relieve Gallstones?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> A diet rich in fiber, plant proteins, fruits and vegetables, and mono-
    and polyunsaturated fats can protect against gallstone formation. </li>
  <li> Weight loss reduces the risk of gallstones in obese individuals, but
    rapid weight loss can increase the risk. Someone who wishes to lose weight
    to decrease the risk of gallstones should try to control their rate of
    weight loss by modestly restricting calories and keeping a small amount of
    fat in their diet. </li>
  <li> The addition of certain foods, including coffee, tea, nuts, and dietary
    spices may reduce the risk of gallstones. </li>
  <li> At least 2‒3 hours of exercise each week can reduce the risk of
    cholecystectomy by about 20%. </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What Natural Interventions May Be Beneficial for Gallstones?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Vitamin C</strong>. Vitamin C decreases oxidative stress, a contributing factor in
    gallstone formation. Low vitamin C intake has been linked with
    increased cholesterol concentration in bile, and a study showed regular
    vitamin C users were 66% less likely to have gallstones than those who
    did not use it. </li>
  <li><strong>Fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids</strong>. Fish oils and omega-3 fatty acids may prevent gallstone formation by
    preventing crystallization. Supplementation with omega-3 fats was also
    shown to attenuate the risk of developing gallstones due to rapid
    weight loss. </li>
  <li><strong>S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe). </strong>
    SAMe has been shown to improve bile flow in people with certain liver
    diseases. It also may decrease the level of cholesterol in the bile.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Curcumin. </strong>
    Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound extracted from turmeric, may reduce
    the chance of gallstones forming by improving cholesterol and lipid
    metabolism. It can also reduce postoperative pain following a
    cholecystectomy. However, people with bile duct obstructions should
    avoid curcumin because it may promote gallbladder contraction.
  </li>
  <li>
     Other natural interventions that may help reduce the risk of gallstone
    formation include <strong>iron </strong>(in those with iron deficiencies),    <strong>vitamin E</strong>, <strong>epigallocatechin gallate </strong>
    (EGCG, a flavonoid found in green tea), <strong>melatonin</strong>, and    <strong>milk</strong> <strong>thistle</strong>.

<p>
The presence of small pouches or pockets in the wall of the large intestine is common with advancing age. These pockets are called    <strong><em>diverticula</em></strong>, and most often form in the lower part of the large intestine, the colon (NIDDK 2012; Mayo
    Clinic 2014a). In Western countries, more than half of people older than 70 have diverticula; and in the United States, colonic
    diverticula are present in about two-thirds of individuals over age 85 (Peery 2013; Ferri 2015).
</p>
<p>
    Many long-held beliefs about diverticula and associated conditions have been challenged over the past several years. For example, it used to be thought
    that fragments of foods containing large fibrous particles, such as popcorn, nuts, seeds, and corn, could become trapped in diverticula and cause
    inflammation (Thaha 2015). However, a large study that monitored over 47 000 men for 18 years showed that eating these foods did <em>not</em> increase risk
    for diverticular inflammation; in fact, study participants who ate the most nuts and popcorn actually had a <em>decreased</em> risk of diverticular
    complications (Strate 2008).
</p>
<p>
    Diverticula do not by themselves ordinarily cause symptoms (Boynton 2013; Sopena 2011). In fact, many people are not even aware they have diverticula until
    they are detected during a routine colonoscopy or other procedure (Strate, Modi 2012; Thaha 2015; Mosadeghi 2015). A person who has diverticula without
    inflammation or any associated symptoms is said to have <strong><em>diverticul<u>osis</u></em></strong>, a term that simply denotes the presence of
    diverticula in the large intestine (NIDDK 2012).
</p>
<p>
Less commonly, however, diverticula do cause problems. A person who has symptoms associated with diverticula is said to have    <strong><em>diverticular disease </em></strong>(Spiller 2015; Strate, Modi 2012; Aydin 2012; Peery 2013).
</p>
<p>
    Inflammation of diverticula—called <strong><em>diverticul<u>itis</u></em></strong>—is a form of diverticular disease that can cause symptoms ranging from
    mild abdominal pain and fever to potentially life-threatening hemorrhage (NIDDK 2012; Thaha 2015; Ferri 2015). Diverticul<u>osis</u> is thought to progress
    to diverticul<u>itis</u> in about 1‒4% of cases (Shahedi 2013).
</p>
<p>
    For decades, the standard of care for diverticulitis emphasized hospitalization and treatment with antibiotics, and possibly invasive surgery. However, a
    growing body of evidence suggests this aggressive approach may not improve outcomes compared with a more conservative approach that emphasizes
    individualized evaluation and treatment, and the judicious use of antibiotics and minimally invasive surgical techniques. Additionally, emerging therapies
    such as <em>probiotics,</em> non-systemic antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory drugs are increasingly being studied for the treatment of diverticular disease
    (McDermott 2014; Turley 2013; Razik 2015; Kruse 2014; Regenbogen 2014; Morris 2014).
</p>
<p>
    In this protocol you will learn about how diverticulosis and diverticular disease develop, and what factors are thought to increase risk of these
    conditions. You will also discover how new evidence is reshaping the treatment of these conditions. Several promising novel and emerging approaches to
treating diverticular disease will be reviewed, and a number of integrative interventions such as <em>probiotics</em>, <em>butyrate</em>, and    <em>natural anti-inflammatory agents</em> will be described as well.

"<div><a name=""Introduction"" id=""Introduction""></a>
<p>Gallstones are hard deposits of bile components  that form in the gallbladder or bile ducts. Bile is produced by the liver and flows into the gallbladder to be stored until it is needed to help with the digestion  and absorption of fat (Maldonado-Valderrama  2011). Signals from the digestive system after eating trigger the  release of bile into the small intestine via the bile ducts. Gallstones may  cause dull pain and indigestion due to chronic inflammation of the gallbladder,  or acute, often severe, pain if they block bile flow. In rare cases, inflammation of the gallbladder, liver, or  pancreas resulting from gallstones can become life-threatening (Zakko 2018; Byrne 2006; Indar 2002; Rangaswamy 2017).</p>
	
<p>Gallstones are very common in Western  societies, and their prevalence is increasing. About  38 million people in the United States have gallstones, and one million new  diagnoses are made each year (Zakko 2018; Stinton 2012; Ibrahim 2018). However,  as many as 80% of gallstone cases are silent, causing no immediate signs or symptoms  (Stinton 2012; Jones, Ghassemzadeh 2018; de Bari 2012). </p>
	
<p>Gallstones  can range in size from a tiny speck to as  large as a golf ball (Mayo Clinic 2017; Zakko  2018). Most gallstones are composed primarily of  cholesterol, but a small percentage are  made mainly of bilirubin and are known as pigment stones. Cholesterol  gallstones usually form in the gallbladder, but some pigment stones form in the  bile ducts (Shaffer 2018).</p>
	
<p>Gallstones  may be associated with increased risks of  gallbladder, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers (Pak  2016). In addition, there is  mounting evidence that gallstones are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease  and increased mortality (Upala 2017;  Shabanzadeh, Sorensen, Jorgensen 2017b; Shabanzadeh, Skaaby, Sorensen,  Jorgensen 2017; Zheng 2016). </p>
	
<p>Silent gallstones are often found incidentally  and usually left untreated, but surgery is  generally recommended in people  with symptoms (Jones, Ghassemzadeh 2018).  Cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) is one of the most common surgeries in the United States and is done  laparoscopically in most cases (Zakko 2018).  In some circumstances, treatment with an oral bile salt that gradually softens  and dissolves gallstones is the preferred approach (Goral 2016).</p>
	
<p>In this protocol you will learn how gallstones  form and are diagnosed, the available conventional treatment options, and  surgical approaches that are continually being refined. You will also learn  about diet, lifestyle, and integrative approaches to reducing the risk of  gallstones and their complications. For example, eating a diet that emphasizes  fiber, fruits and vegetables, plant proteins, and monounsaturated and  polyunsaturated fats can help prevent the formation and growth of cholesterol  gallstones (Di Ciaula 2017). Physical  activity not only protects against gallstones but can also help prevent silent  gallstones from becoming problematic (Shabanzadeh,  Sorensen, Jorgensen 2017a; Chuang 2001). Gallbladder function may be  improved and the risk of cholesterol gallstones further decreased by integrative  interventions such as fish oil (Mendez-Sanchez  2001), vitamin C (del Pozo 2014),  soy lecithin (Pakula 1996), curcumin from  turmeric (Rasyid 2002), and  epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) from green tea (Shan  2008). Finally, emerging evidence suggests medications targeting  metabolic disturbances such as high cholesterol and glucose levels may have a  role in preventing cholesterol gallstones (Husain  2015; Liao 2017).</p>

<p>The colon wall is  made up of several layers, including the<em> mucosa</em>, <em>submucosa</em>, and a <em>muscular</em> outer wall. The muscular layer  itself has an inner and outer layer (Maykel  2004).</p>
<p>In the most common type of diverticula, the mucosa and  submucosa are forced through weak areas in the muscular layer (Strate, Modi 2012; von Rahden 2012). Between 65% and 90% of colonic  diverticula occur in the sigmoid colon, which is on the left side and close to  the end of the digestive tract, with the remainder located in other regions (Maykel 2004; Bugiantella 2015). </p>
<p>Diverticula form as a result of a complex interaction of age,  diet, and structural and functional changes in the nerves and muscles of the  colon wall. These factors may contribute to weakness of and increased pressure on  the colon wall (Strate, Modi 2012; von Rahden  2012; Bugiantella 2015; Humes 2014). </p>
<p>In 1‒4% of cases, diverticula become inflamed; this is known  as diverticulitis (Shahedi 2013). It used  to be thought that mechanical obstruction of diverticula by fecal matter or  undigested food particles caused diverticular disease, but newer research  suggests that changes in the microbial composition of the intestinal tract  (which can create a pro-inflammatory environment) and changes in colon motility  are important contributors (von Rahden 2012;  Tursi 2012; Strate, Modi 2012; Peery 2013). </p>

"<div><a name=""Background"" id=""Background""></a>
  <h2>Anatomy  of the Biliary System</h2>
<p>The gallbladder is a pear-shaped, muscular,  pouch-like organ that is roughly three to six inches long and sits under the  liver in the upper right region of the abdomen. Some of the bile produced by  the liver flows directly into the small intestine, but about 50% flows into the  gallbladder where it is stored and concentrated until needed to facilitate fat  digestion. Between meals, the gallbladder is relaxed, but during meals, signals  from the digestive tract stimulate contractions of the gallbladder and bile is  released, through a system of ducts, into the intestine. In addition to helping  with digestion, bile carries waste products from the liver to be eliminated  through the digestive tract (JHM 2018; Zakko  2018; Housset 2016). </p>
	
<p></p><div align=""center""> <strong>Figure  1</strong>: <strong>The  biliary system</strong>.</div>
	
<p></p><div align=""center""><img class=""img-responsive"" alt=""Diagram of biliary system"" src=""/protocols/images/prot_Gallsontespg2.jpg""></div>
	
<h2>Gallstone  Formation</h2>
	
<p>Bile, a greenish-yellow fluid produced in the  liver, is made of bile salts, cholesterol, phospholipids (a type of fatty  molecule), electrolytes, bilirubin, and water (JHM  2018; Hundt 2018). When excess cholesterol is present in bile, it can  crystalize. Sludge forms when cholesterol crystals mix with mucus in the  gallbladder. Over time, these crystals can aggregate and form stones (Jones, Ghassemzadeh 2018; Tanaja 2018). </p>
	
<p>Gallstones that are more than 70% cholesterol  are known as <strong>cholesterol stones</strong>; if  cholesterol content is between 30% and 70%, they are called <strong>mixed stones</strong>; and gallstones with a  cholesterol content less than 30% are <strong>pigment  stones</strong> (Molvar 2016). Calcium salts,  such as calcium bilirubinate and calcium phosphate, are concentrated in pigment  gallstones, making these types of gallstones easy to visualize on an X-ray.  Calcium, usually as calcium carbonate, is present in smaller amounts in  cholesterol and mixed gallstones (Njeze 2013;  Portincasa 2012; Kaufman 1994). As many as 90% of gallstones in people  living in Western societies are cholesterol and mixed gallstones that form in  the gallbladder (Mayo Clinic 2017; Molvar 2016;  Shaffer 2018).</p>
	
<p>Pigment stones usually form when there is  excess bilirubin (ie, yellow pigment produced during the breakdown of red blood  cells) in the bile. Conditions such as liver cirrhosis and certain blood  disorders can lead to excess bilirubin in the bile and contribute to the  formation of black pigment gallstones (Tanaja  2018; Mayo Clinic 2017). Parasitic infections and anatomical narrowing  of bile ducts are major causes of brown pigment stones (Shaffer 2018). </p>
	
<h2>Gallbladder  Motility and Cholesterol Stone Formation</h2>
	
<p>In the early stages of cholesterol sludge and  gallstone formation, the muscular function of the gallbladder weakens, reducing  the gallbladder's ability to respond to signals. Lack of bile flow due to low  gallbladder motility then further contributes to sludge and stone formation by  allowing time for increased cholesterol concentration, crystallization, and  aggregation (Tanaja 2018; Jones, Ghassemzadeh  2018; Chen 2015).</p>
	
<h2>Oxidative  Stress </h2>
	
<p>Oxidative stress contributes to gallstone  development. The process of gallstone formation and growth has been shown to be  enhanced in the presence of oxidized bilirubin, which is found in gallstones (Sanikidze 2016; Lichtenberg 1988). People with  gallstones often have high levels of oxidized lipids in their blood, and  gallbladders removed due to gallstones show high levels of oxidative damage as  well as low levels of antioxidant enzymes (Geetha  2002). </p>
	
<h2>Complications  of Gallstones</h2>
	
<p>A biliary blockage due to trapped gallstones  can lead to acute complications such as (Zakko  2018; Tanaja 2018; Shaffer 2018; Zimmer 2015):</p>
	
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cholecystitis: </strong>inflammation of the gallbladder</li>
  <li><strong>Choledocholithiasis</strong>:  one or more gallstones lodged in the common bile duct</li>
  <li><strong>Cholangitis:</strong> infection with inflammation in the bile ducts due to an obstruction</li>
  <li><strong>Pancreatitis:</strong> inflammation of the pancreas due to obstruction of the pancreatic duct </li>
  <li><strong>Ileus:</strong> a rare and dangerous complication wherein the GI tract no longer properly  propels ingested food material through the GI tract via peristaltic action. A  large gallstone may cause Ileus.  </li>
</ul>
	
<p>In some cases, gallstones cause chronic  inflammation in the gallbladder (<strong>chronic  cholecystitis</strong>), leading to thickening of the gallbladder walls (Jones, Ferguson 2018).</p>

"<div><a name=""Risk%20Factors"" id=""Risk Factors""></a>

<p>Gallstone formation is influenced by  interactions between genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors (Pak 2016). Some of those factors include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Diet</strong>.  A Western-style diet is one of the strongest risk factors for cholesterol  gallstones. Specifically, high intakes of calories, carbohydrates, saturated  fats, and sugar coupled with low intake of fiber have been linked to increased  risk, while consumption of polyunsaturated fats, fiber, fish, fruits and  vegetables, and nuts have been associated with lower risk (Pak 2016).</li>
</ul>
<div class=""protSidebar"">
<h2>Food  Intolerances and Gallstone Risk</h2>
	
<p>Evidence from several studies suggest food  allergies and intolerances promote gallstone formation by triggering  gallbladder inflammation and slowing gallbladder emptying (Gaby 2009). In one study in 69 participants  with gallstones or post-cholecystectomy syndrome, gallbladder symptoms resolved  in all participants after one week on an elimination diet. Reintroducing  certain foods triggered a return of symptoms, presumably due to food allergy or  intolerance. Between one and seven trigger foods were identified for each  participant, the most common being eggs (causing symptoms in 93% of  participants), pork (causing symptoms in 64% of participants), and onions  (causing symptoms in 52% of participants) (Breneman  1968; Gaby 2009). </p>
	
<p>Celiac disease, an autoimmune disease caused  by permanent gluten intolerance, may be an underappreciated risk factor for  gallstones (Wang, Liu 2017). A higher  risk of gallstone-related pancreatitis has been noted in people with celiac  disease (Sadr-Azodi 2012). Decreased  gallbladder motility, possibly due to poor communication between the digestive  tract and gallbladder, appears to be a contributing factor (Fraquelli 2003). Adhering to a gluten-free  diet may help restore normal gallbladder function and prevent gallstones in  celiac disease patients (Wang, Liu 2017).</p>
</div>	
	
<ul>
  <li><strong>Age</strong>.  Risk of developing cholesterol and pigmented stones increases with age (Shaffer 2018; Lee 2015). One reason may be  that bile acid production declines with age, leading to greater concentration  of cholesterol in bile (Pak 2016). Aging  may also be associated with reduced gallbladder motility (Macias 2012).</li>
  <li><strong>Gender</strong>.  Women have a higher risk of cholesterol  gallstones than men. This may be due to the effects of female hormones:  estrogens increase cholesterol secretion into bile, and progesterone decreases  gallbladder motility. Exposure to elevated levels of female hormones, such as  during pregnancy or due to estrogen therapy and possibly oral contraceptives, further  increase the risk (Pak 2016; Shaffer 2018; Fogel  2016; Wang, Wang 2017).</li>
  <li><strong>Ethnicity</strong>.  Native North and South Americans, as well as Mexican Americans, have higher  rates of gallstones and gallbladder disease than other ethnic groups. For  example, among Native Americans, over 64% of women and nearly 30% of men have  gallstones (Stinton 2012). South Asians  have a higher risk of brown pigmented gallstones, which are related to  bacterial and parasitic infections (Tanaja 2018;  Vitek 2012). </li>
  <li><strong>Genetics</strong>.  Having a family member who has had gallstones is associated with an increased  risk, and research suggests some individuals are genetically predisposed to  forming cholesterol or pigment gallstones (Shaffer  2018; Lammert 2016).</li>
  <li><strong>Obesity</strong>.  A higher incidence of cholesterol gallstones is seen in people who are  overweight or obese, especially women. The risk is particularly high in those  with abdominal obesity (Pak 2016; Sekine 2015).</li>
  <li><strong>Fasting  and rapid weight loss</strong>. While gradual weight loss may reduce  gallstone risk, rapid weight loss increases the risk of gallstone formation.  Prolonged fasting and weight cycling (eg, as a result of ""yo-yo dieting"") are  also correlated with higher cholesterol gallstone risk (Pak 2016; Shaffer 2018; Njeze 2013). </li>
  <li><strong>Total  parenteral nutrition (TPN)</strong>. TPN, in which all nutrition is  delivered intravenously, is frequently associated with rapid weight loss and  lack of gallbladder stimulation, both of which can contribute to gallstone  formation (Shaffer 2018).</li>
  <li><strong>Other  diseases and conditions. </strong>Metabolic syndrome, characterized by a  group of cardiovascular risk factors, including insulin resistance, high blood  pressure, high blood glucose levels, low HDL cholesterol levels, high  triglyceride levels, and abdominal obesity, is associated with increased cholesterol  secretion and gallstone formation (Shabanzadeh,  Skaaby, Sorensen, Eugen-Olsen 2017; Sang 2016). <em>Celiac disease</em>, which may impair gallbladder function, has also  been proposed as a risk factor for cholesterol gallstones (Wang, Liu 2017). Cirrhosis, nonalcoholic fatty  liver disease, other liver diseases; cystic fibrosis; and Crohn's disease are  also risk factors for gallstones; as are certain blood disorders like sickle  cell anemia, beta-thalassemia, and other causes of hemolytic anemia (Shaffer 2018; Stinton 2012; Njeze 2013). </li>
  <li><strong>Medications</strong>.  Several pharmaceuticals are known to increase the risk of gallstones. In  addition to estrogens, these include octreotide (Sandostatin, used mainly to  treat acromegaly), ceftriaxone (Rocephin, an antibiotic), and thiazide  diuretics (such as hydrochlorothiazide [Apo-hydro], used mainly to treat high  blood pressure). On the other hand, statins (such as atorvastatin [Lipitor],  used to treat high cholesterol levels) and metformin (Glucophage, used to treat  type 2 diabetes) may decrease gallstone risk (Stinton  2012; Liao 2017).</li>
  <li><strong>Sedentary  lifestyle</strong>. Physical activity protects against  cholesterol gallstone formation, possibly by improving gallbladder and gut  motility and through positive effects on cholesterol metabolism. It has been  suggested that an average of two to three hours of recreational physical  activity each week could reduce the chance of needing surgery for gallstone  disease by 20% (Pak 2016). </li>
</ul>

	<div class=""protSidebar"">
<h2>  Hormone Therapy and Gallstones</h2>
<p>  The effects of female hormones on gallbladder  function and bile composition appear to underlie the higher gallstone risk seen  in women compared with men (Lee 2015; Shaffer 2018).  Some studies have shown that additional hormone exposure through oral contraceptives  and post-menopausal hormone therapy may further elevate risk, but findings have  been mixed. A recent meta-analysis of the research found that hormone therapy  use increased risk of gallstones by 79%, but oral contraceptives had no effect (Wang, Wang 2017). Estrogen seems to be  responsible for this negative effect, as the addition of progesterone to  estrogen therapy does not appear to alter its effect on gallstone risk (Simonsen 2013; Dhiman 2006). Although most of  the participants in these studies were using oral conjugated estrogens from  horse urine, a preliminary comparison trial found that topical bioidentical  estradiol had the same effect as oral conjugated estrogens on bile cholesterol  saturation and crystallization time after eight weeks of use (Uhler 1998).

<p>
    About 80‒85% of individuals with diverticulosis will never experience any symptoms; about 10‒15% will develop diverticular disease; and roughly 5% will
    have at least one episode of acute diverticulitis (Bugiantella 2015). For those who develop diverticular disease, symptoms can have a rapid, or acute,
    onset, or can be ongoing and chronic, and can vary in intensity from mild to severe (Sopena 2011; Boynton 2013).
</p>

<h2>
    Chronic Diverticular Disease
</h2>
<p>
    There are several different specific symptom patterns of chronic diverticular disease:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD).</strong>
    This condition is characterized by recurring or persistent lower left abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation or diarrhea, in the absence of
    diverticulitis. SUDD can resemble irritable bowel syndrome. Fever, elevated white blood cell count, and other signs of an infectious or inflammatory
    condition are not characteristic of SUDD (Tursi 2010).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Segmental colitis associated with diverticulitis (SCAD).</strong>
    SCAD is thought to occur in about 0.3‒1.3% of people with diverticulosis, and appears to be similar to inflammatory bowel disease. The symptoms most
    commonly associated with SCAD are rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and abdominal pain; fever and elevated white blood cell count do not usually occur with this
    condition (Mann 2012).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Chronic diverticulitis. </strong>
    Chronic diverticulitis is<strong> </strong>characterized by mild and persistent diverticular inflammation that may cause abdominal pain but usually does
    not cause fever (Sheiman 2008).<strong></strong>
</p>
<h2>
    Acute Diverticular Disease
</h2>

<p>
    The characteristic symptom of acute diverticulitis is pain in the lower left abdomen that tends to worsen with movement; pain may also be right-sided or
    originate in other parts of the abdomen. Fever, usually below 102°F, is another common symptom. Other possible symptoms include abdominal bloating, lack of
    appetite, nausea (generally without vomiting), constipation or diarrhea, and painful urination. In severe acute diverticulitis, the abdomen may become
    stiff and rigid (Wilkins 2013; Medina-Fernandez 2015).
</p>
<p>
    An episode of acute diverticulitis may become a medical emergency necessitating surgical intervention if complications arise. Potential complications
    include bleeding, abscess, fistula, perforation, or obstruction (Schaffzin 2004; Köckerling 2015).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Distinguishing Symptomatic Uncomplicated Diverticular Disease from Irritable Bowel Syndrome</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) due to the overlap in their hallmark symptoms:
    abdominal discomfort or pain and disturbance in bowel habits (Spiller 2012). It can also be difficult to distinguish these conditions because they appear
    to co-occur in many people (Jung 2010; Yamada 2014).
</p>
<p>
    What’s more, researchers speculate that a bout of acute diverticulitis may trigger colonic sensory and motor nerve damage, changes in bacterial ecology,
    and mucosal inflammation, resulting in a set of chronic abdominal and digestive symptoms sometimes referred to as “post-diverticulitis IBS.” One study
    found that people with a history of diverticulitis were 4.6 times more likely to receive a diagnosis of IBS during a nine-year period than people without a
    history of diverticulitis (Strate, Modi 2012).
</p>
<p>
    A correct diagnosis is critical in these cases, since surgery may be a reasonable choice for someone with recurrent acute diverticulitis but is likely to
    yield poor results in IBS (Spiller 2014).
</p>
<p>
    It appears that the pattern of abdominal pain may be helpful in distinguishing SUDD from IBS. In one study, 72 people with colonoscopy-confirmed
    diverticulosis and suffering from abdominal pain were given a preliminary diagnosis of either SUDD or IBS-like symptoms, based on the location and duration
    of their pain; those with lower left-sided abdominal pain lasting more than 24 hours met the diagnostic criteria for SUDD, and those with pain in other
    parts of their abdomen were considered to have IBS-like symptoms. Researchers then found that no one in the IBS-like symptom group, and 64% of those in the
    SUDD group, had elevated fecal calprotectin, a marker of intestinal inflammation, thereby showing that moderate-to-severe lower left-sided pain lasting
    more than 24 hours is correlated with diverticular disease (Tursi 2015).

"<div><a name=""Causes"" id=""Causes""></a>
<h2>
Diverticulosis
</h2>
<p>
Factors currently known to increase risk of diverticulosis include advancing age, obesity (especially central or visceral obesity), and smoking (Comstock
2014; Nagata 2014; Spiller 2015; Medina-Fernandez 2015; Nagata 2013).
</p>
<h2>
Diverticular Disease
</h2>
<p>
Several factors increase the risk of progression from diverticulosis to diverticular disease (Peery 2013; von Rahden 2012):
</p>
<p>
<strong>Low-fiber diet</strong>. In a study of 47 033 healthy adults followed for an average of 11.6 years, those with the highest dietary fiber intake (&gt;25 g daily) were 41% less
likely to be hospitalized for diverticular disease compared with those with the lowest intake (&lt;14 g daily) (Crowe 2011). A four-year study in over
43 000 participants found that those with the highest intake of insoluble fiber had an approximately 40% lower risk of diverticular disease (Aldoori 1998).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sedentary lifestyle</strong>. Several studies have found that increased physical activity appears to be protective against diverticular disease (Aldoori, Giovannucci, Rimm, Ascherio
1995; Williams 2009).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Obesity</strong>. Most studies show that higher body mass index, obesity, and abdominal obesity increase the risk of diverticular disease and its complications (Spiller
2015; Bose 2013; Dobbins 2006; Strate, Liu, Aldoori, Syngal 2009; Sorser 2009).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Smoking</strong>. Most studies suggest smokers are at increased risk of complications of diverticular disease, particularly perforation, but also abscess and
hospitalization (Turunen 2010; Papagrigoriadis 1999; Collins 2015; Hjern 2011; Aldoori, Giovannucci, Rimm, Wing 1995).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Alcohol</strong>. Research into alcohol consumption and risk of diverticular disease has been inconclusive (Aldoori 2002; Strate 2012), though a study that included 23
people under age 50 found that in that age group, chronic alcohol consumption was associated with greater than three-fold higher odds of having an episode of
acute diverticulitis (Pisanu 2013).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), pain relievers, and steroids</strong>. The use of aspirin and other NSAIDs such as ibuprofen; opioid pain relievers such as codeine; and corticosteroids, especially inhaled steroids used to
treat asthma, appear to increase the risk of diverticulitis and its complications (Hjern 2015; Kvasnovsky 2014; Strate 2011).
</p>
</div>",https://www.lifeextension.com/Protocols/Gastrointestinal/Diverticulosis-and-Diverticular-Disease/Page-05
"<div><a name=""Symptoms"" id=""Symptoms""></a>

<p>Biliary pain is the most common symptom of  gallstone disease. Patients typically describe acute, severe pain in the  upper-right or upper-mid region of the abdomen, often radiating to the right  shoulder or between the shoulder blades. Biliary pain may last for minutes to  hours and may occur after eating or be constant (Mayo  Clinic 2017; Shaffer 2018; Zakko 2018; Tanaja 2018; Fogel 2016). </p>
	
<p>Biliary pain that lasts longer than 24 hours  points to the possibility of complications of gallstone disease. Certain  symptom patterns can help predict the location of the stone and which  complication is likely (Fogel 2016):</p>
	
<ul>
  <li>Symptoms of acute <strong>cholecystitis</strong> include  nausea, fever, and intense tenderness in the upper-right abdomen (Zakko 2018; Shaffer 2018). </li>
  <li>Symptoms of acute <strong>cholangitis</strong>, an infection of the bile duct, often include a classic  group of signs and symptoms known as Charcot's triad—persistent abdominal pain,  fever, and jaundice (Rumsey 2017; Zimmer 2015). </li>
  <li>Symptoms of acute <strong>pancreatitis</strong> due to gallstone obstruction of the pancreatic duct  include pain in the upper-middle abdomen that may radiate to the mid-back.  Gallstone pancreatitis may be accompanied by <strong>peritonitis</strong> (Shaffer 2018), a  painful and potentially life-threatening condition in which the lining of the  inner abdominal wall becomes inflamed (Mayo Clinic  2015; Banks 2010; Hazem 2009). </li>
</ul>
	
<p>Chronic cholecystitis causes tenderness and a  dull pain in the upper right abdomen that radiates to the middle of the back.  It can also cause digestive symptoms such as gas, bloating, nausea, and  occasional vomiting. These symptoms are usually worse after eating fatty foods  and often occur in the evening. People with chronic cholecystitis sometimes  have acute flare-ups of intense biliary pain (Jones,  Ferguson 2018).</p>

"<div><a name=""diagnosis"" id=""diagnosis""></a>

<h2>
    Diverticulosis 
</h2>
<p>
    Diverticulosis is usually found incidentally during an unrelated diagnostic or screening procedure (Sopena 2011). In fact, asymptomatic diverticulosis is
    the most common finding on routine cancer-screening colonoscopy (Shahedi 2013).
</p>
<h2>
    Diverticular Disease 
</h2>

<p>
    Diverticular disease, including acute diverticulitis, can often be diagnosed on the basis of the patient’s signs and symptoms, including physical exam
    findings, medical history, and laboratory testing. In approximately one-third of cases, diagnostic imaging is necessary to make a diagnosis (Andeweg 2014;
    Bugiantella 2015).
</p>
<p>
    Several abdominal and pelvic ailments must be ruled out to diagnose diverticular disease. These include appendicitis, bowel obstruction, colon cancer,
    ectopic pregnancy, gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, kidney stones, diseases of the ovaries, pancreatitis, and urinary
    tract infection (Wilkins 2013). Computed tomography (CT) scan or abdominal ultrasound are the preferred diagnostic imaging modalities, when necessary, to
    establish a diagnosis of diverticular disease (Aydin 2012; Andeweg 2014).
</p>
<p>
    Due to the risk of pain or complications, colonoscopy cannot be performed during an episode of diverticular disease or acute diverticulitis. However, it
    may be recommended four to six weeks after an acute episode has resolved, particularly in cases with complications or after a first episode of acute
    diverticulitis to rule out an underlying cancer (Bugiantella 2015; Wilkins 2013). Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence that CT imaging used in the
    initial assessment is adequate to identify cancer, leading some researchers to recommend against additional colonoscopies beyond the regular colon cancer
    screening schedule (Medina-Fernandez 2015).
</p>
<p>
    While uncomplicated diverticular disease is not associated with changes in blood test parameters, acute diverticulitis may cause blood test abnormalities
    including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>High white blood cell count (leukocytosis). </strong>
        A high number of white blood cells is seen in about 55% of cases of acute diverticulitis (Wilkins 2013) and indicates active infection or inflammation
        (Asadollahi 2011).<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Elevated C-reactive protein. </strong>
        C-reactive protein is a marker of inflammation. High levels (&gt;50 mg/L) are frequently seen in people with acute diverticulitis, and very high levels
        (&gt;200 mg/L) may be a sign of perforation (Wilkins 2013).<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Anemia. </strong> Anemia may develop due to bleeding of diverticula, especially in elderly patients (Lizardi-Cervera 2008).</li>

 <h1>Prostate Cancer Prevention Controversy</h1>
 <p><strong>By William  Faloon</strong></p>
<p>An  editorial I generated for the May 2013 issue of<strong><em> Life Extension magazine®</em></strong> received quite a bit of feedback and critique. </p>
    <p>Some <strong><em>Life Extension</em></strong>® customers said it  should be a mandatory part of physician education. Others raised concerns about  the use of the <strong>PSA </strong>blood test as a <strong>screening </strong>tool, why I suggest <strong>Avodart</strong>® for certain men, and why <strong>drugs </strong>were mentioned since there are <strong>nutrients </strong>that function via similar mechanisms. </p>
    <p>The  most impressive critique came from <strong>Patrick C. Walsh,  MD</strong>, who may be the most renowned prostate cancer expert in the  world. Dr. Walsh was involved in identifying the genetic characteristic of  hereditary prostate cancer and pioneered “nerve-sparing” surgery. I have urged  hundreds of prostate cancer patients to travel to Johns Hopkins to have <strong>Patrick Walsh </strong>perform their surgery, as I consider him the  finest in the world. </p>
    
<div class=""wwwMagCellImageContainer"" style=""margin-right:5px;margin-bottom:5px;float:left""><img alt=""risk of aging"" src=""/protocols/images/pc_prevention/dec2013_awsi_01.jpg"" border=""0"">  </div>
    
    <p>So  when Dr. Walsh writes us, I pay attention, and Life Extension customers should be  informed that there are credentialed individuals that are against using drugs  in the class of <strong>Avodart</strong>®  for cancer pre­vention purposes. </p>
    <p>Shortly  after my 2013 editorial was published, the <strong>American  Urological Association </strong>issued revised guidelines for <strong>PSA screening</strong>. They now say PSA screening should be  mostly considered only for men aged <strong>55-69</strong> (AUA 2013).  We vehemently disagree with this new recommendation and chastise this group for  not emphasizing the need to devise safer and more efficient ways of performing  prostate diagnostics. </p>
    <p>To  emphasize the seriousness of all this, the chart titled “A Risk of Aging” shows  the spiraling incidence of pros­tate cancer that occurs as men age. Autopsy  results reveal that <strong>85% </strong>of men have <strong>atypical cells </strong>in their <strong>prostate glands </strong>and <strong>1 in 4 </strong>has <strong>cancer</strong> (Billis 1986).  While many men with atypical lesions or even malignant cells in their prostate  do not ever progress to clini­cal disease, aging men cannot ignore this  problem. </p>
    
<div class=""wwwMagCellImageContainer"" style=""margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:5px;float:right""><img alt=""digital rectal exam"" src=""/protocols/images/pc_prevention/dec2013_awsi_02.jpg"" border=""0"">  </div>
    
    <p>The  public still accepts absurdly short life spans. We at <strong><em>Life Extension </em></strong>do not and that  is just one reason why our position on prostate cancer <strong><em>differs </em></strong>from the mainstream. </p>
    <p>There is  something to be said about attending live lectures as opposed to staying glued  to our computer/TV screens. A good speaker can make an impact that you may  forever remember.</p>
    <p>I’ll  never forget a lecture I attended in <strong>1977 </strong>at a South Florida condominium  social hall. The place was packed with retirees. The lecturer was over age 80  and passionately urged all men to visit a urologist once a year for a <strong><em>digital  rectal exam</em></strong>. He began by reading a long list of the names of the many  mem­bers of his retirement commu­nity who had suffered agonizing deaths from <strong>metastatic  prostate cancer</strong>.</p>
    <p>The  lecturer understood that a digital rectal exam would not detect all prostate  cancers, but he knew it could save lives. If the <strong>PSA </strong>blood test had been  available at that time, I can only imagine how feverish this benevolent speaker  would have been in advocating PSA tests to his fellow men. </p>
    <p>Move forward <strong>35  years </strong>and the federal government and some mainstream medical groups are  recommending against <strong>PSA  screening</strong>, which is more reliable  than <strong><em>digital rectal exams</em></strong>, though both ideally should be done  annually (AUA 2013; Moyer 2012). </p>
    <h2>What Makes Prostate Cancer Different?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Prostate  cancer </strong>is unusual in that it has a <strong>blood marker </strong>called <strong>prostate-specific  antigen (PSA) </strong>that can facilitate <strong><em>early </em></strong>detection, thereby  enabling therapies to be employed before cancer spreads to regional  lymph nodes or distant metastases occur (Catalona 1994). </p>
    <p>With the advent and wide­spread  use of <strong>PSA </strong>screening, an argument can be made based on a large human  study that huge numbers of men could be spared agonizing deaths from metastatic  prostate cancer (Bokhorst 2013; USDC 2012). The earlier diagnosis of prostate  cancer, how­ever, must be put into context of the individual patient to  ascertain which men need to be treated and which men are reasonable can­didates  for active surveillance or “watchful waiting.”</p>
    <p>The  journal <em>European Urology </em>published a study in <strong>2013 </strong>con­ducted on  nearly 35,000 men aged 55-69 (Bokhorst 2013). This data came from the <strong>European  Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer</strong>, a major, robust study  examin­ing the impact of <strong>PSA screening </strong>over a median period of <strong>13  years </strong>on prostate cancer mortality. The eye-opening conclusion was that men  who underwent repeat­ed PSA screening were <strong>51% </strong>less likely to die  from prostate cancer than men who did not undergo screening (Bokhorst  2013). If the statistics from this study are applied to the entire population  of men aged 55-69 in the United States, PSA screening could potentially save  over <strong>80,000 </strong>lives in a 13-year period (USDC 2012).</p>
    <p>The <strong>United States Preventive  Services Task Force </strong>(USPSTF) published a report in <strong>2012 </strong>rec­ommending  that men stop under­going <strong>PSA screening </strong>(Moyer 2012).</p>
    <p><strong><em>Life  Extension </em></strong>disagreed with the <strong>USPSTF </strong>recommendation,  particularly as it relates to our customers to whom we are stead­fastly  committed. We know that in the absence of PSA screening, prostate cancer will  once again be diagnosed at an advanced stage, when there is painful bulky dis­ease  and only a small chance of curative therapy. </p>
    <p>The widespread use of PSA testing  beginning in <strong>1987 </strong>enabled doctors to identify prostate can­cer at a  greatly reduced stage of disease (NCI 2012). If the dictum of the <strong>USPSTF </strong>is  followed, a major advance in medicine will be erased.</p>
    <h2>The Staggering Statistics</h2>
    <p>
      Here is what the <strong>American  Cancer Society </strong>says about <strong>pros­tate cancer </strong>in the United States (ACS  2013d):</p>

    <p>If <strong>prostate cancer </strong>were an  infectious illness, there would be widespread panic. To put this in  perspective, <strong>HIV </strong>infected less than <strong>50,000 </strong>Americans in 2011 (CDC  2013a). </p>
    <p>In <strong>2013</strong>, the <strong>United  States Preventive Services Task Force </strong>urged all Americans to undergo  routine <strong>HIV screening</strong> (USPSTF  2013). </p>

    <p>There  are valid reasons for HIV screening, but almost <strong>five times </strong>more Americans are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year compared to HIV (ACS  2013d; CDC 2013a). The same gov­ernment-funded <strong>Task Force </strong>that suggests  universal <strong>HIV screening </strong>does not want aging men to ben­efit from <strong><em>early  detection </em></strong>of pros­tate cancer. They maintain that the treatment is  worse than the disease. They confuse the mes­sage conveyed by the PSA with the  judgment and actions of phy­sicians who too often are pro­grammed toward  invasive and expensive therapies.</p>
    <p>Do we toss out the  baby with the bath water, so to speak, because physicians are not taking the  time, or possibly do not have the exper­tise to advise patients soundly? The  actions of the <strong>USPSTF </strong>and the <strong>American Urological Association </strong>should  be to fix the  deficiency of the physician with strict guide­lines, just as was done in the  1980s to alter the routine use of the <strong><em>rad­ical mastectomy </em></strong>performed  in almost every woman diagnosed with breast cancer (Ghossain 2009). </p>
    <p>The <strong>United  States Preventive Services Task Force </strong>(USPSTF) prefers aging men wallow in  igno­rance concerning their prostate health, which within the next decade will  send death rates spiral­ing upwards. The <strong>USPSTF </strong>clear­ly wants aging men  to bury their heads in the sand and not concern themselves about prostate  cancer. </p>
    <p>The hard  statistics showing more than <strong>238,000 </strong>newly-diag­nosed prostate cancer  cases annu­ally proves otherwise (ACS 2013d). While the USPSTF recommendations  will save government health programs billions of dollars in the short term,  there will be catastroph­ic long term costs to pay when record numbers of men  who could have been cured instead develop metastatic disease. </p>
    <h2>Why Life Extension Customers Are  Different </h2>
    <p>
      There are factors that influ­ence  mainstream recommenda­tions that do not pertain to <strong><em>Life Extension </em></strong>customers.  The typi­cal American male over age 60 is remarkably unhealthy, often  suffering multiple underlying maladies relating to <strong><em>metabolic syndrome </em></strong>and  other pathologies called “co-morbidities” (Ervin 2009). This is indicative of a  state of disease in the biologic environment of the  patient. </p>
    <p>A frank diagnosis (or indication)  of prostate cancer should act as an early warning that something is amiss in  the patient’s overall health and that further attention is war­ranted to  various systems. Thus a diagnosis of prostate cancer need not be equated with  invasive proce­dures such as radical prostatecto­my, radiation therapy,  cryosurgery, high-intensity focused ultrasound, or androgen deprivation  therapy, but with a call to the patient and physician to be alert to pathologic  states that if corrected can stabilize or repair some or all of the systems  that are amiss.</p>

    <p>One reason the <strong>USPSTF </strong>believes that <strong>PSA screening </strong>should be halted is that so many men are  already in such poor health they are likely to die of some other cause before pros­tate cancer becomes clinically relevant (Moyer 2012). </p>
    
<div class=""wwwMagCellImageContainer"" style=""width:151px;margin-right:20px;margin-bottom:5px;float:left""><img alt=""Prostate cancer deaths"" src=""/protocols/images/pc_prevention/dec2013_awsi_04.jpg"" border=""0""><p align=""center""><small>Huge Decline in Prostate Cancer Deaths Since Advent of PSA Screening</small></p></div>
      
<p>This is  the <strong>opposite </strong>of <strong><em>Life Extension </em></strong>customers, who go to  extraordinary efforts to slow aging and protect against degenerative disease.  It would be irrational for healthy Life Extension customers to stop <strong>PSA  screening </strong>merely because their age group on aver­age is in such poor  overall health.</p>
    <p>Few doctors today have com­prehensive  programs designed to <em>reverse </em>multiple underlying fac­tors that lead to  clinically-diag­nosed prostate cancer. The typical aging person does not know  about lifestyle changes, drugs, and nutrients that may keep an indo­lent cancer  confined to the pros­tate gland.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Life  Extension </em></strong>customers have long been armed with this infor­mation  and have access to Wellness Specialists to help guide them to more effective ways of  working with their physician to improve their odds of keeping low-grade  prostate cancer, or indications of low-grade prostate cancer (such as rising  PSA), under control. This protocol is dedicated to reminding mem­bers and alerting the  public about these novel approaches to disease prevention. </p>
    <p>Most  urologists believe when PSA reaches a certain level that their only choice is  to perform <strong>needle biopsies</strong>. They often overlook existing tests, such as  testing and properly analyzing blood results of <strong>free PSA </strong>percentage, <strong>PSA  den­sity</strong>, and <strong>PSA velocity</strong>, along with other diagnostics such as <strong>PCA3  urinary test </strong>and advanced non-invasive techniques that can pro­vide  additional insight that may reduce the need for invasive proce­dures (Vessella  2000; Lieberman 1999; Stephan 2005; Loeb, Carter 2013; Hessels 2009). Urology  patients are not always made aware of these non-invasive choices, and  especially of the importance of measuring the PSA rise over time (PSA velocity)  to help ascertain if prostate biopsy is warranted. </p>
    <p>What  clearly separates <strong><em>Life Extension </em></strong>customers from the general public,  however, are the aggressive steps we take to achieve meaningful extensions of  our healthy life spans. Those advising against PSA screening are largely  “writing-off” men over <strong>age 70</strong>. </p>
    <p><strong><em>Life  Extension </em></strong>male mem­bers need to ensure their <strong>prostate health </strong>is  assessed and main­tained at an optimal level for the many decades of extended  life they expect.</p>
    <h2>American Urological Association  Capitulates</h2>
    <p>
      When the  United States Preventive Services Task Force suggested that aging men stop PSA  screening altogether, the <strong>American Urological Association </strong>disagreed.  About a year later, the <strong>American Urological Association </strong>issued revised  guidelines that will sharply reduce the number of PSA screenings performed (AUA  2013; Pollack 2012; Allard 2012). And other professional groups have issued  similar opinions (Qaseem 2013). </p>
    <p>The  latest recommendation from the <strong>American Urological Association </strong>(AUA) is  for men over age <strong>70 </strong>to avoid <strong>PSA screening</strong> (AUA 2013). The AUA is essentially  saying that once you move past <strong>age 70</strong>, your life span is too short to  bother with.</p>
    <p>The <strong>American  Urological Association </strong>is also writing off men aged <strong>40-54 </strong>for  prostate screening because of the relative low incidence of cancer in this  group compared to men over <strong>54</strong> (AUA 2013). This is a tragedy  as it condemns younger men who do develop prostate cancer to probable death.  Earlier diagnosis provides a huge advantage when attempting cura­tive therapy.  Just ask Prostate Cancer Foundation Chairman <strong>Michael Milken</strong>, who  insisted on a PSA test at age 46 and dis­covered he had prostate cancer in time  to benefit from curative therapy (Moore 2005).</p>
    <p>On the  flip side are famous peo­ple like Frank Zappa, Telly Savalas, Bill Bixby, and  other younger men who likely could have identified their prostate cancer  earlier had they undergone PSA screening (PCCNC 2013). These  men probably had rising PSA levels long before metastatic disease manifested.</p>
    <h2> Overlooking More Efficient Procedures</h2>
    <p>
      In  recommending more limit­ed PSA-screening, the <strong>American Urological  Association </strong>is tacitly admitting that conventional diag­nostic and early  treatment of pros­tate cancer is so inadequate, or performed so incompetently,  that it’s better to wait for full-blown <strong><em>metastatic disease </em></strong>to  manifest. Once advanced stage prostate can­cer develops, however, treatments  are seldom curative. </p>
    <p>Instead of looking at  physi­cians who are diagnosing and treating early stage prostate can­cer using  less invasive procedures and then emulating these skilled artists, the <strong>American  Urological Association </strong>has apparently caved in to accepting and promoting  mediocrity within their profession. </p>
    <p>A big problem is  that most urol­ogists are not properly assessing PSA results, nor are they  efficient­ly implementing further diagnostic and treatment protocols. And on  the other end of the spectrum are the many men who are promptly sent for  ultrasound-guided biop­sies after one PSA elevation. And again, to add insult  to injury, the biopsies are often not ones tar­geted to abnormalities within  the prostate but merely targeting the prostate as a gland.</p>
    <p>It is one issue  to biopsy an ultrasound lesion that may rep­resent the needle in the haystack,  but it’s another issue, and a sad one at that, when it is the hay­stack that is  the target. You know that this is the case when a man has had 2, 3, or 4  prostate biopsies showing no cancer cells, and then he is referred, finally, to  a compe­tent physician who uses excellent ultrasound equipment to directly  target suspicious lesions within the prostate gland.</p>
    <p>In these  cases, it seems the diagnosis is magically made; but it’s not magic, it is just  an issue of a far higher degree of <strong>compe­tence</strong>. All men are not equal in  talent and all equipment is not of the same quality. The unfortunate outcome is  that too many aging men are being subjected to need­less and incompetently  admin­istered invasive procedures that sometimes result in unnecessary  suffering and premature death.</p>
    <p>Instead  of recommending that medical professionals upgrade their evaluation and  treatment protocols to deliver state-of-the-art technology, the United States  Preventive Services Task Force suggests that aging men not undergo PSA  screening at all, while the <strong>American Urological Association </strong>limits its  recommen­dation for PSA screening mostly to men <strong>aged 55-69</strong> (AUA 2013).</p>
    <p>The <strong>media </strong>treats these author­itarian groups as being virtually <strong>infallible</strong>.</p>
    <h2> Prostate Cancer Not an Isolated Disease</h2>
    <p>
      A common  mistake made by doctors and patients is thinking that prostate cancer manifests  in isolation from other pathological events occurring as a person ages. This is  not the case.</p>
    <p>Research  shows that other serious pathological conditions are frequently seen in  prostate cancer patients (Post 1999). These factors involved in prostate  malignancy can adversely impact other parts of the body (Howcroft 2013).</p>
    <p>For example, <strong><em>Life  Extension </em></strong>has shown one way prostate can­cer and coronary  atherosclerosis are related is that they are both influenced by the breakdown  of <strong>bone</strong> (Faloon 2009). As  an aging man devel­ops osteoporosis, excess calcium released into the blood  contributes to arterial <strong><em>calcification</em></strong> (Faloon 2009). What’s  lost in the bone ends up in the coronary arteries and other major vessels of  the body (Faloon 2009; Demer 2004). </p>
    <p>These  atherosclerotic lesions are not vascular “cal­cifications” but bone growth or  osteogenesis (Demer 2004; Demer 2009; Abedin 2004). Bone  breakdown also releases <strong><em>growth factors </em></strong>into the blood that  promote the proliferation of what may have been indo­lent prostate cancer cells  (Patterson 2010). Therefore, it  should come as no surprise that nutrients that prevent <strong>bone loss </strong>such as <strong>vitamin K2 </strong>also inhibit <strong>vascular calcification</strong> (Beulens 2009; Fodor 2010). </p>
    <p>PSA screening thus pro­vides an important clue of a  man’s overall health, with the advantage of identify­ing problems <strong><em>early </em></strong>enough to take  effective corrective actions. That’s a LOT of bene­fit for assessing one’s  prostate gland once a year utilizing <strong>PSA blood testing</strong>.</p>

<p>The level of <strong><em>medical com­petency </em></strong>directly affects the quality and  quantity of the lives of others, yet there is not enough monitoring of patient  outcomes. </p>
<p>When it comes to treating  prostate disease, there needs to be a reporting of serious side effects such as  inconti­nence, impotence, and major blood loss or urethral stric­tures after a  urologist performs a radical prostatectomy. </p>
<p>This kind of <strong>accountabil­ity </strong>is relatively non-existent in today’s  bureaucratic medi­cal environment, though the Internet may eventually enable  patients to assess the degree of <strong><em>medical competency </em></strong>of a physician they entrust their life to. </p>

</div></div>
  
<h2>What Makes Cancer Cells  Propagate?</h2>
    <p>
      When designing  prevention and treatment strategies, <strong><em>Life Extension </em></strong>focuses on  underlying <strong><em>mechanisms of disease </em></strong>that are fueled by specific <strong><em>biological  fac­tors </em></strong>in the body. This is not perfect science however because you  can block one factor involved in tumor development, and cancer cells  will use other growth-promoting vehicles to progress. </p>
    <p>What we seek to do is  stay two steps ahead of the cancer by cut­ting off its many growth  promoters and pathways used to escape eradi­cation. For instance, we know that <strong><em>dihydrotestosterone </em></strong>(DHT) pro­motes prostate cell growth (pro­liferation) (Wen 2013). This  growth affects both benign prostate cells as well as cancerous ones. In the  context of a man with prostate cancer, a serial rise in PSA is circumstan­tial  evidence that the tumor cell population is increasing. Such an increase in PSA is not only of importance insofar as  prompting investigations to rule out pros­tate cancer. We have evidence that  PSA breaks down natural barriers that keep isolated tumor cells con­fined to  regions within the pros­tate gland. Remember that PSA is a <em>serine protease</em>,  an enzyme that breaks  down proteins (Pezzato 2004). One such  containment protein degraded by PSA is the <strong>extra-cellular matrix</strong>, i.e.,  the natural barrier that may confine cancer cells within the prostate gland. </p>
    <p>But  suppressing <strong>DHT </strong>alone is not a total solution. There are other prostate  tumor growth pro­moters such as <strong>insulin</strong>, <strong>estrogen</strong>, <strong>prolactin</strong>, <strong>transforming growth factor beta (TGF-1 </strong>and <strong>TGF-2), </strong>and <strong>vascular  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) </strong>that also should be brought under control  (Cox 2009; Singh PB 2008; Giton 2008; Dagvadorj 2007; Tu 2003; Ling 2005;  Häggström 2000). Fortunately, many  of the <strong>nutrients </strong>Life Extension customers already take can help suppress <strong><em>growth  factors </em></strong>used by prostate cancer cells (and other cancers) to proliferate (Meyer  2005; Ripple 1999; Yan 2009; Hussain 2003; Giovannucci 1995; McLarty 2009;  Liang 1999; Singh RP 2008; Smith 2008; Xing 2001). </p>
    <p>There are other  mechanisms involved in the evolution of a prostate tumor such as <strong><em>5-lipoox­ygenase </em></strong>(5-LOX) (Gupta S 2001; Matsuyama 2004; Ghosh 1997) and <strong><em>cyclo­oxygenase-2 </em></strong>(COX-2) (Xu 2008) that  can be markedly improved by <strong>dietary changes</strong>, along with <strong>curcum­in</strong> (Bengmark 2006; Lantz 2005), <strong>fish oil</strong> (Taccone-Gallucci 2006; Calder 2003; Norrish 1999), <strong>boswellia</strong> (Safayhi 1995)<strong>,</strong> <strong>aspirin</strong> (Salinas 2010)<strong>,</strong> <strong>Zyflamend®</strong> (Bemis  2005; Yang P 2007; Capodice 2009; Huang 2012; Sandur 2007)<strong>,</strong> and prescription COX-2 inhibitors like <strong>Celebrex</strong>® (Harris 2009; Pruthi 2006).</p>
    <p>Genetic factors  involved in prostate cancer initiation and promotion may be favorably modulated  by taking relative­ly high doses of <strong>vitamin D</strong> (Chen L 2009; Flanagan 2006). Hormonal  influences like prolac­tin and insulin can benefit from using  prolactin-suppressing drugs like cabergoline (<strong>Dostinex</strong>®)  (Webster 1992) or Lisuride  (Bohnet 1979) and the insulin-sup­pressing  drug <strong>metformin</strong> (Clements 2011;  Hitron 2012; Wright 2009). </p>
    <p>The  overriding goal in reversing any cancer is to induce favorable changes in the <strong><em>genes </em></strong>that regu­late cell proliferation and apop­tosis (cell destruction). We  know that nutrients like <strong>curcumin</strong> (Teiten 2010; Shishodia, Singh 2007; Reuter 2011), <strong>genistein</strong> (Chen 2011; Lakshman 2008; Davis 1998; Davis  1999), <strong>fish oil</strong> (Berquin 2007; Deckelbaum 2006), and <strong>vita­min </strong>D (Krishnan 2003; Mantell 2000) favorably  affect genes involved in carcinogenesis, as do drugs like <strong>aspirin</strong> (Yoo 2007; Kim 2005), <strong>metfor­min</strong> (Jalving 2010; Avci 2013; Isakovic 2007), <strong>finasteride (Proscar®)</strong> (Luo 2003), and <strong>dutasteride (Avodart®)</strong> (Schmidt 2009).</p>

<h2> Importance of Food Choices </h2>
<p>
      What one  eats (and doesn’t eat) makes a huge impact on whether prostate cancer  ever develops (Miano 2003; Itsiopoulos 2009). </p>
    <p>Healthier  eating patterns also improve the odds of treatment success (Ornish 2008;  Kenfield 2007). </p>
    <p>A rising  PSA level or prostate cancer diagnosis can be the signal that it’s time to  switch what you eat more towards a <strong>Mediterranean diet </strong>that focuses on  fish instead of red meat, whole vegetables instead of glucose-spiking  starches/sug­ars, foods cooked at lower tem­peratures, and reduced intake of  omega-6 fats (Ferris-Tortajada 2012; Kenfield 2013; Sofi 2008).</p>
    <p>Those who pioneered  aggres­sive <em>dietary changes </em>to help treat cancer were decades ahead of  their time. While it’s unlikely that aggressive dietary alterations will cure  clinically diagnosed prostate cancer, there are strong mecha­nistic values to  consuming foods/beverages that suppress prostate cancer proliferation (like  cruci­ferous vegetables [Xiao 2003; Garikapaty 2005; Srivastava 2003] and green tea [Chuu 2009; Thakur 2012]) as opposed  to continuing to eat foods that have been related to higher prostate cancer  risk such as red meat (Punnen 2011; Michaud 2001; Richman 2011), starches and sug­ars (Bidoli 2005; Freedland 2009), excess dairy (Michaud 2001; Song 2013; Chan 2001;  Gao 2005), and excess omega-6 fats that  contrib­ute to a high omega-6:omega-3 ratio (Williams 2011; Masko 2013). </p>

  <div style=""padding:10px;background-color:rgb(226, 226, 226)"">

<p>If a <strong><em>needle biopsy </em></strong>of the prostate detects a malig­nancy,  it will be <strong><em>graded </em></strong>with a <strong>Gleason score </strong>num­ber as follows: </p>
    <p><strong>Under  7</strong>(<strong>low-grade</strong>): Slow growing and not likely to be aggressive (SJPHS  2013). Low-grade prostate cancers are seldom the cause of death in men over age  70, especially those that are in poor health (Stangelberger 2008). Low-grade  are the majority of prostate tumors found and the ones where “watchful waiting”  is often employed in lieu of radical procedures (Stangelberger 2008; Gofrit  2007). </p>
    <p><strong>Over  7</strong><strong> (high-grade)</strong>: Fast growing, aggressive tumors that  require intervention such as radical pros­tatectomy, radiation, androgen  ablation, etc (SJPHS 2013). High-grade prostate tumors make up less than <strong>15%</strong>* of newly diagnosed prostate cancers  (Gofrit 2007). </p>
    <p>*Caveat: Errors in  the pathology lab can result in lethal mistakes, such as issuing a low Gleason  score to a high-grade tumor. These errors are discovered when a radical  prostatectomy is performed and it is found to have a Gleason score of <strong>8-10 </strong>as opposed to a <strong>6 </strong>Gleason score found in the biopsied  specimen (Carter 2012). </p>
    <p>A study published in <strong>2012 </strong>evaluated a group of men with  early-stage prostate cancer who received a <strong>4,000 IU </strong>vitamin D3 supplement each day for a year (Marshall  2012). </p>
    <p>Mean <strong><em>25-hydroxyvitamin D </em></strong>blood levels at base­line were <strong>32.8 ng/mL </strong>and increased to <strong>66.2 ng/mL </strong>after <strong>vitamin  D </strong>supplementation (Marshall  2012). </p>
    <p>After one year, <strong>55% </strong>of the men showed a decrease in  tumor-sensitive biopsies or a decrease in the <strong>Gleason </strong>tumor score. An additional <strong>11% </strong>showed no change (meaning the cancer  had not progressed). </p>
    <p>The study also showed that  over time, supplemen­tation with vitamin D3 led to a decrease in the num­ber of  positive cores taken during prostate biopsies. This is in stark contrast to the  untreated control group who experienced an increase in the number of posi­tive  cores on repeat biopsies (Marshall 2012). </p>
    <p>Only <strong>34% </strong>of men taking vitamin D progressed  compared to <strong>63% </strong>of the control group. This repre­sents  a <strong>46% </strong>reduction in the number of men who moved to  advancing disease, indicating powerful effects of taking <strong>4,000 IU/day </strong>of vitamin D for one year. </p>
    <p>The men in this study had  not received any other treatment than <strong>vitamin D </strong>and all were in an <strong><em>active surveillance </em></strong>program that carefully measured dis­ease  progression or regression. </p>
    <p>This study showed that just one intervention (<strong>4,000  IU/day/vitamin D</strong>) was  able to reverse the clinical course of disease in a significant  percentage of these prostate cancer patients. </p>
    <p>This study helps validate  the importance of <strong>PSA  screening</strong>. Had these men not known  they had early-stage prostate cancer, they would not have known to take <strong>vitamin D</strong>, and their disease would have likely  progressed until symptoms such as <strong>bone pain </strong>manifested. </p>
</div></div>

<p>The section of this  protocol titled, “<strong><em>Impact of Diet on Prostate Cancer Risk and Mortality” </em></strong>describes  foods that promote prostate cancer and which ones protect against it. We  explain how consuming the wrong foods can fuel prostate cancer growth, while  following healthy dietary choices can reduce the risk that you will develop  clinically diagnosed prostate cancer. </p>
    <p>Some men  instinctively start eating healthier as they mature, but it took a higher <strong>PSA </strong>read­ing (<strong>1.4 ng/mL</strong>) ten years ago for me to alter my diet in a  healthier direction. My diet is not perfect, but it’s a huge improvement over  what I consumed in my younger years. My last PSA test came in at <strong>0.4 ng/mL</strong>…a <strong>71% </strong>decrease in  a ten-year period (PSA levels nor­mally rise with age).</p>
    <p>If I had  not had my PSA checked annually, I may have continued making poor dietary  choices and may have developed prostate cancer by now. My father was diagnosed  with it around age 75. He consumed a typical diet for his era, with a daily intake  of red meat and high glycemic starches like potatoes, while never touching a  vegetable or fruit. He set himself up perfectly to encourage prostate cancer  growth and mutation.</p>
    <p>Even for  those who aren’t sure if they are making the proper food choices, laboratory  tests like the <strong>Omega Check<sup>™</sup> </strong>test (a fatty acid profile) enable one to  evaluate their diet and supplement pro­gram and make changes to opti­mize  health. You are what you eat and what you assimilate does have a bearing on  your health.</p>

<h2>A More Rational Approach</h2>

<p>Most  prostate tumors are very sensitive to their internal envi­ronment or what we  prefer to call their “biological milieu.” We know this because when <strong><em>andro­gen-deprivation  therapy </em></strong>is prop­erly administered, PSA levels can drop to near zero and  prostate cancer cells die through the process of programmed cell death, a.k.a. <strong>apoptosis</strong> (Grossmann 2001; Nishiyama 2011). </p>
    <p>However, it is not uncommon for  prostate cancers to eventu­ally find other <strong><em>growth factors </em></strong>to fuel  their continued prolifera­tion and the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic  effects of androgen-deprivation therapy wear off, as evidenced by a  continuously rising PSA that was once brought down to below <strong>0.05  ng/mL </strong>by adequate­ly suppressing testosterone (Cox 2009; Singh PB 2008; Giton  2008; Dagvadorj 2007; Tu 2003; Ling 2005; Häggström 2000; Nishiyama 2011).</p>
    <p>When a diagnosis of  prostate cancer occurs in the setting of a rising PSA in the lower range (below <strong>4 ng/dL </strong>ideally), <strong><em>Life Extension </em></strong>views this as an oppor­tunity  for early intervention that might result in one’s body regain­ing control over  tumor expansion.</p>
    <p>We know that the drug <strong>Avodart</strong>® (dutasteride)  lowers PSA levels by inhibiting the formation of <strong><em>dihydrotestosterone </em></strong>(DHT)  (Arena 2013). Avodart® and its less potent cous­in Proscar® (finasteride) are  5ARIs (<em>5-alpha reductase </em>inhibi­tors) (Knezevich 2013). <em>5-alpha  reductase </em>is the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT (Knezevich 2013).  The effect of DHT on prostate cancer cell growth is five times greater than  that of testos­terone (UCF 2013). By blocking DHT, drugs like Avodart® and  Proscar® provide a unique opportunity to suppress tumor growth. At the same  time, comprehensive adjunct protocols can be initiated that are designed to  deprive tumor cells of growth factors or fuels, further inhibiting cancer  growth and/or invasion.</p>
    <p>For example, a recent study found that men taking <strong><em>finaste­ride </em></strong>for prostate cancer  preven­tion were far more likely to benefit if they had lower <strong><em>estrogen </em></strong>levels prior to initiation of treatment with finasteride (Kristal  2012). This study clearly showed high concentra­tions of estrogen to be  associat­ed with increased cancer risk. So much so that the elevated estrogen  neutralized the prostate cancer prevention impact of finasteride. Life  Extension has repeatedly warned aging men about the crit­ical need of achieving <strong>estrogen balance</strong>. One reason was our con­tinued observation of high  estro­gen levels in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients. Men can easily  suppress elevated estrogen levels with <em>aromatase-inhibiting </em>therapies  (Ta 2007).</p>
    <p>So in response to a rising PSA and/or other indicators  of prostate disease, men have a range of diag­nostic options to assess whether  there is underlying malignancy and if there is, what may be help­ing to fuel it  (such as elevated DHT or estrogen). </p>
    <p>If non-invasive diagnostics indi­cate malignancy, a <strong>color  Doppler ultrasound-guided biopsy </strong>can indicate whether it may be <strong>high-grade </strong>(Gleason score over 7 that requires treatment) or <strong>low-grade </strong>(Gleason  score under 7 that may be controlled with comprehensive  surveillance/intervention). </p>
    <p>Some <strong><em>Life Extension </em></strong>mem­bers choose to  attack a rising PSA as if there is already <strong>low-grade </strong>prostate cancer  present, especial­ly if they suffer urinary symptoms relating to benign prostatic  hyper­plasia (enlargement). In consulta­tion with their doctor, they may choose  to take <strong>0.5 mg </strong>of <strong>Avodart</strong>® daily (though it may not need to be  taken every day) and simul­taneously introduce an <strong><em>arsenal </em></strong>of <strong><em>mechanistic  approaches </em></strong>to restrain benign and/or tumor cell propagation and induce  benign and/or tumor cell apoptosis. </p>
    <p>The use of Avodart® or finaste­ride can shrink  prostate gland vol­ume by <strong>25% </strong>thus relieving benign symptoms, improve the accura­cy of a needle  biopsy if this diag­nostic procedure is needed, and deprive tumor cells of one  growth promoter, i.e. DHT (Cohen 2007; Nickel 2004). </p>
    <p>A comprehensive <strong><em>arsenal </em></strong>of <strong><em>mechanistic approaches </em></strong>might involve healthy eating,  high doses of specific <strong>nutrients </strong>(at least tem­porarily), <strong>hormone  adjustment </strong>aimed at reducing <strong>DHT</strong>, <strong>insu­lin</strong>, <strong>prolactin </strong>and <strong>estrogen </strong>(but maintaining <strong>free </strong>testosterone [Yavuz 2008] in youthful ranges), and drugs like <strong>metformin </strong>and <strong>aspirin</strong>. If <strong>prolactin </strong>levels are elevated, the drug <strong>Dostinex</strong>® (carbergoline) can be used to suppress this cancer  stimulating pituitary hormone. </p>
    <p>I know  this paradox has trou­bled aging men for decades, but according to a number of  observa­tions and some published studies, low levels of testosterone seem  to predispose men to prostate can­cer, including more <strong>high-grade </strong>Gleason  score tumors. One expla­nation is that only low levels of testosterone are  needed to con­vert into excess <strong><em>dihydrotestoster­one </em></strong>(DHT)  (Nishiyama 2011). When prostate  cells are deprived of their <strong>free testos­terone</strong>, they may mutate to  over-respond to other growth vehicles such as estrogen, insulin-like-growth  factor, and DHT (Kristal 2012). </p>

  <div style=""padding:10px;background-color:rgb(226, 226, 226)"">

<p>About half of US men  diagnosed with prostate can­cer are classified as low-risk by use of  conventional measures such as Gleason score (a form of tumor grading), the  prostate-specific antigen test (PSA), and a physical exam (Genomic Health  2013). Nonetheless, nearly <strong>90% </strong>of these low-risk patients  will choose to undergo immediate aggressive treatment such as radical  prostatectomy or radiation even though there is less than a <strong>3% </strong>chance of deadly progression (Genomic  Health 2013). </p>
<p>A new test called <strong>Oncotype DX </strong>is now available to physicians and  their patients. It measures the level of expression of <strong>17 genes </strong>across four biological path­ways to  predict prostate cancer aggressiveness (Genomic Health 2013). </p>
<p>Test results are reported as a <strong>Genomic Prostate Score  (GPS) </strong>ranging from <strong>0 to 100</strong>; this score is assessed along with  other clinical factors to clarify a man’s risk prior to treatment intervention  (Genomic Health 2013). This multi-gene test can be used in conjunction with the  needle biopsy sample taken <em>before </em>the prostate is removed, thereby  providing the opportunity for low risk patients to avoid invasive treatments.  According to the principal investigator of the validation study, “Individual  biologi­cal information from the Oncotype DX prostate can­cer test almost <strong>tripled </strong>the number of patients who can more  confidently consider active surveillance and avoid unnecessary treatment and  its potential side effects” (Genomic Health).</p>
<p> The advantage of this test  for those who choose the <strong><em>comprehensive  surveillance program </em></strong>utilized  by Life Extension customers (which involves the use of several drugs, targeted  nutrients, and adherence to healthy dietary patterns) is to provide greater  assur­ance the right course of action is being followed. </p>

<p> <strong>Prolaris® </strong>is another genomic test developed to  aid physicians in predicting prostate cancer aggressive­ness in conjunction  with clinical parameters such as Gleason score and PSA (Myriad 2013).</p>
<p> Prolaris<strong>® </strong>measures prostate cancer tumor biology  at the molecular level. By measuring and analyzing the level of expression of  genes directly involved with can­cer replication, Prolaris® may be able to more  accurately predict disease progression (Myriad 2013). </p>
<p>Prolaris<strong>® </strong>is a tool designed to measure the  aggres­siveness of a patient’s cancers to better predict and stratify an  individual’s relative risk of disease progres­sion within ten years (Myriad  2013). It may enable physicians to better define a treatment/monitoring  strategy for their patients. </p>
<p>Prolaris<strong>® </strong>claims to be significantly more prognos­tic  than currently used variables and provides unique additional information that  can be combined with other clinical factors in an attempt to make a more  accurate prediction of a patient’s cancer aggressiveness and therefore disease  progression (Myriad 2013). </p>
<p>Prolaris<strong>® </strong>has been shown to predict clinical pro­gression  in four different clinical cohorts, in both pre and post-treatment scenarios  (Myriad 2013). </p>
<p> In the treatment of prostate cancer,  Prolaris<strong>® </strong>is prognostic at the point of diagnosis  and in the post-surgery setting (Myriad 2013).</p>
<p> At diagnosis, Prolaris<strong>® </strong>can help to identify patients with less  aggressive cancer who may be candidates for active surveillance. In addition,  Prolaris<strong>® </strong>can define patients who appear clinically  low-risk but have a more aggressive disease that requires more aggressive  treatment. </p>
<p>Prolaris<strong>® </strong>testing is also well suited for use in  post-prostatectomy patients that have higher risk features after surgery to  better estimate their risk of disease recurrence and therefore adjust the level  of monitoring or add additional therapy. </p>

<h2>How Life Extension Differs From the Mainstream </h2>
<p>
      A common  approach to deal­ing with biopsied-confirmed <strong>low-grade </strong>prostate cancer  is called “<strong><em>watchful waiting</em></strong>.” Under this scenario, PSA tests are  performed at reasonable intervals and treat­ment decisions based on indica­tors  of disease progression (or regression). </p>
    <p>In the  presence of persistently rising PSA and other markers, the patient and their  doctor discuss wide ranges of treatment options ranging from surgical removal  of the prostate gland, different forms of radiation, cryoablation, and/or  androgen ablation to temporarily reduce PSA and buy more time. All of these  treatment modalities have side effects to consider. </p>
    <p>Instead of merely  “watching” a PSA rise until risky therapies are required, we at <strong><em>Life  Extension </em></strong>view a <strong>low-grade </strong>prostate cancer (or even a biopsy  that reveals no cancer)  as an opportunity to inter­vene aggressively with a multitude of non-toxic  approaches that ben­efit one’s overall health. Success or failure is measured  by monthly PSA testing, along with other tests to ensure that other growth fac­tors  like insulin, estrogen, DHT, and prolactin are being adequately suppressed. </p>
    <p>To clarify the point  about a no cancer  diagnosis, the accuracy of typical initial needle biopsies today is only around <strong>75%</strong> (Taira 2010). So if your urologist tells you he has good news,  i.e., the biopsy showed no tumor cells in your prostate gland, there may be a <strong>25% </strong>chance you do have tumor cells, thus mak­ing the kinds of comprehensive  intervention that benefits your entire body a rational choice. </p>
    <p>So rather than “<strong><em>watchfully  wait</em></strong>,” as your underlying disease may progress, we suggest <strong>com­prehensive  intervention</strong>. The objective is to take away every route that enables tumor  cells to propagate and escape confinement within the prostate gland. </p>
    <p>For those  who require a prostate biopsy, there are new (and expensive) <strong>genetic tests </strong>that  may more accurately predict which tumors are aggressive and like­ly to  metastasize and those that are so indolent that only minimal changes may be  needed to keep control over them. If these genet­ic tests prove themselves in  the clinical setting (outside the bias of company-sponsored clinical tri­als),  intelligently using the results of these tests can spare many men from needless  treatments and pro­vide information about genetic mutations to target in  prostate cells that may enable better long-term control.</p>

<p>What patients should understand is the  diagnosis of prostate cancer per <strong><em>ultrasound-guided biopsies </em></strong>is  also related to the skill of the phy­sician performing the procedure, as well  as the nature of the ultrasound (gray-scale <em>versus </em>color Doppler). CDU  (color Doppler ultrasound) also indicates the degree of vascularity  (angiogenesis) of the cancer, which if present is a factor associated with tumor  aggressiveness. The more vascular the cancer the more aggressive it is. Dietary  approaches, sup­plements, and medications to reduce angiogenesis should be  consid­ered in the arsenal of how we prevent the emergence or evolution of  clinically significant prostate cancer. </p>
<p>An additional emerging area that may  allow a better understanding of clinically significant prostate cancer and  clarify the issue of risk of high-grade prostate cancer with 5-alpha reductase  inhibitor drugs like Avodart® and Proscar® involves replacing the transrectal  ultrasound of the prostate (TRUSP) with MRI utilizing parameters such as DWI  (diffusion weighted imaging) and the associated grading of DWI using the  Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC). Studies indicate a much higher specificity  for the diagnosis of prostate cancer than TRUSP when DWI and ADC are used  together (Shimamoto 2012; Ibrahiem 2012). </p>

<h2> Our Enlarging Prostate Glands </h2>
<p>
    Aging  results in a proliferation of prostate cells that is technical­ly referred to  as <strong>benign prostatic hyperplasia </strong>(BPH) (Gharaee-Kermani 2013). The graph­ic  titled “The Development of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia” depicts an advanced  case of BPH with a constrict­ed urethra that would impede or block urine flow. </p>

    <p>Symptoms  associated with BPH include frequent urination and urinary hesitancy that can  be especially troublesome at night (Gharaee-Kermani 2013). In severe cases  obstruction of urine flow requires insertion of a catheter into the bladder via  the penile urethra. </p>
    <p>A major  culprit involved in the benign over-proliferation of pros­tate cells is <strong><em>dihydrotestosterone </em></strong>(DHT) (Clark 2004). Drugs such as Avodart® (dutasteride) or Proscar® (finaste­ride) reduce DHT levels and shrink the  size of an enlarged prostate gland, which reduces BPH symp­toms (Schmidt 2011). These drugs also lower <strong>PSA </strong>levels by almost <strong>50%</strong>,  which may reflect the mechanism(s) that explain why men taking these drugs have  reduced overall pros­tate cancer risk (Kaplan 2002; Handel 2006; Nelson 2010). In two large studies, men taking Avodart® or Proscar® had about a <strong>24% </strong>reduced risk of  prostate cancer (Thompson 2003; Andriole 2010). </p>

<div class=""wwwMagCellImageContainer"" style=""margin-right:5px;margin-bottom:5px;float:left""><img alt=""advanced case of BPH"" src=""/protocols/images/pc_prevention/dec2013_awsi_14.jpg"" border=""0"">  </div>

<p>Men should know that <strong><em>testosterone </em></strong>is not the culprit behind prostate problems. Numerous studies suggest  that youthful lev­els of testosterone do not increase prostate cancer risk (Tan  2004; Agarwal 2005; Gooren 2003; Morgentaler 2007; Rhoden 2008; Raynaud 2006). What happens in the aging man’s body, however, is  that testosterone con­verts to estrogen and DHT, and these two testosterone metabolites have  been shown to be involved in benign and malignant prostate disease.  Fortunately, there are low-cost methods available to suppress <strong>DHT </strong>and <strong>estrogen </strong>in aging men, while maintaining youthful ranges of <strong>free testosterone</strong>.</p>
    <p>Recall that PSA is not just a marker of prostate cancer, but  functions as a <strong><em>tumor promoter </em></strong>by degrading barrier structures in  the prostate gland that may contain isolated tumor cells. </p>
    
<div class=""wwwMagCellImageContainer"" style=""margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:5px;float:right""><img alt=""Obstruction of urine flow"" src=""/protocols/images/pc_prevention/dec2013_awsi_15.jpg"" border=""0"">  </div>
    
    <p>What troubles <strong>Dr.  Walsh </strong>and some other experts is that some of the men taking Avodart® or fin­asteride who do contract prostate cancer  have been shown in two studies to develop more aggres­sive forms of the  disease. They are so concerned that they warn men not to use these drugs for the  purpose of prostate cancer prevention, as does the FDA. </p>
    <p>On the  flip side are propo­nents of these drugs who point out that Avodart® as well as Proscar® (finasteride)  reduce prostate gland volume by such a degree that the ability to identify  high-grade tumors via prostate biopsy is improved. So it does not appear that  Avodart® or Proscar® causes  more <strong>high-grade </strong>tumors. Instead, these drugs facilitate earlier  detection of such cancers, which is another reason to con­sider taking them.</p>
    <p>A frustration with  needle biop­sies is that they miss as many as <strong>20-30% </strong>of prostate cancers  (Taira 2010; Rabbani 1998; Numao 2012). The larger one’s  prostate gland, the easier it is to have the biopsy miss those sites that are malig­nant.  The illustration titled “12-core Prostate Needle Biopsy” depicts a 12-core  biopsy to show why a larger prostate gland makes it more difficult to detect  malignant cells. So an advantage of shrinking one’s prostate gland using drugs  like Avodart® or Proscar® is  that if a needle biopsy is required, it may more accurately detect underlying malignancy  (Kulkarni 2006). </p>
    <p>In the December 2013 Life  Extension magazine article titled <strong>The Avodart®-Proscar® Debate</strong>, there is compel­ling evidence that  these drugs may reduce <strong>high-grade </strong>prostate cancer risk.</p>
    <p>Another  virtue to using <em>5-alpha reductase inhibitors </em>(like Avodart® or Proscar®) is that in the  presence of prostate cancer, PSA levels don’t decrease as much after these drugs are  initiated (Kaplan 2002; Handel 2006; Nelson 2010). </p>
    <p>Physicians using <em>5-alpha  reduc­tase inhibitors </em>should take into account the PSA-lowering effect of  these agents by doubling the PSA lab value (Andriole 2006). Given  that PSA decreases less in the presence of prostate cancer, the doubling of PSA  will result in a higher value of PSA and will trigger the need for diagnostic  investigations sooner. </p>
    <p>What  doctors have observed is that drugs like Avodart® or  finaste­ride suppress PSA levels more effec­tively in men with benign prostate  enlargement or low-grade prostate cancer. When PSA levels drop then start  raising again, this indicates that the 5-alpha reductase inhibitor is reducing  low-grade cells of ques­tionable clinical significance but is not affecting  higher grade malig­nancies (Cohen 2007). This finding is  another plus for using a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor as it can increase the sen­sitivity  of the PSA test to reveal which men need aggressive diag­nostics such as needle  biopsies.</p>

<h2> Why We Suggest Certain Drugs</h2>
<p>
      When it  comes to combat­ting cancer, <strong><em>Life Extension </em></strong>long ago learned that  the initial treat­ment regimen should be aggres­sive enough to deprive tumor  cells of an opportunity to mutate into forms that are resistant to  future therapies. If we know of a rela­tively side effect-free <strong>drug </strong>that  works via a single or multiple mechanisms to impede tumor sur­vival, we’re  going to include it in our <strong>comprehensive surveillance program</strong>. </p>
    <p>Let’s talk first  about <strong>metfor­min</strong>. It was used in England in <strong>1958 </strong>but did not make  it into the United States until <strong>1995</strong>—<strong>37 years later</strong> (Dowling 2011)<strong>!</strong> I am familiar  with metformin because the <strong>FDA </strong>tried to have me incarcerated for recom­mending  it as an <strong>anti-aging drug </strong>long before it was “approved” to treat <strong>type  II diabetes</strong>. </p>
    <p>What’s been happening  over the last ten years is an explosion of published studies that consistently  show that <strong>metformin </strong>reduces the risks of certain tumors and may be an  effective cancer treatment (Hirsch 2009; Anisimov 2005; Vazquez-Martin 2011;  Tomimoto 2008; Gotlieb 2008; Cantrell 2010; Libby 2009; Memmott 2010).</p>

    <p>People  ask me all the time, how can an anti-diabetic drug work so well against cancer?  The encouraging news is that <strong>metfor­min </strong>functions via multiple mech­anisms  to create a less favorable environment for tumor progres­sion (Evans 2005;  Currie 2009; Nagi 1993; Choi 2013; Luo 2010; Ben Sahra 2011; Loubière 2013;  Zakikhani 2008; Ben Sahara 2008; Ersoy 2008). We  know that insulin (and glucose) increase the risk of many tumors (Parekh 2013). This is of partic­ular concern to obese men with  prostate tumors. Metformin low­ers blood glucose and insulin lev­els. The  sidebar titled “Anti-Cancer Actions of Metformin” reveals the multiple  anti-cancer mechanism of metformin.</p>
    <p>There are nutrients  that can have similar effects such as <strong>stan­dardized green coffee extract</strong> (Ong 2013). We  nonetheless suggest that a man with an elevated or rising PSA should ask his  doctor to consider prescribing <strong>metformin</strong>. The start­ing dose can be <strong>500  mg </strong>of extend­ed release (Metformin ER) taken with breakfast each day. Under  the supervision of the patient’s local medical doctor, the dose can be  increased to <strong>500 mg </strong>ER taken at breakfast and at dinner. (Dose ranges  for non-extended release metformin are <strong>250-850 mg </strong>taken before no more  than three meals a day.) Metformin is an inexpen­sive generic drug and can be  taken along with nutrients (like <strong>green coffee extract</strong>) that similarly  function to reduce glucose/insulin. </p>
    <p>Metformin does more  than slash tumor-promoting glucose/insulin levels. It also acts directly on  cancer cells to induce apopto­sis and/or inhibit proliferation (Jalving 2010). Metformin does this conserving the process by which  food is con­verted to energy (Choi 2013; Luo 2010; Ben Sahra 2011; Loubière  2013). Healthy cells react to  metformin by adjusting their functions to use less energy. A cancer cell, on  the other hand, that is forced to minimize energy consumption is less able to  exhibit aggressive metastatic or prolifera­tive behavior (Dunlap 2012). In other scenarios, the energy stress caused by met­formin  is sufficient to cause can­cer cell death. </p>
    <p>The <strong>National  Cancer Institute </strong>is sponsoring a clinical study where metformin will be  tested to see if it can slow the progression of prostate cancer in men under­going  active surveillance (watchful waiting) with low-grade tumors (Fleshner 2013). We hope the study design includes the measurement  of 2-hour post-prandial (2 hours after meals) blood glucose levels as well as  gly­cosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) to ascertain that optimal dosing of study  subjects has been achieved.</p>

      <p>Numerous studies show the anti-diabetic  drug <strong>metformin </strong>can slow growth of existing cancers and decrease risk of  developing new can­cers. Some studies show metformin may protect against  prostate can­cer and aid in treatment. Here are some of its <strong>anti-cancer </strong>mechanisms: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong> Metformin </strong>reduces levels of <strong>glucose</strong>, <strong>insulin</strong>,  and <strong>insulin-like growth factors </strong>that fuel tumor growth (Evans 2005;  Currie 2009; Nagi 1993; Choi 2013). </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Metformin </strong>activates a powerful molecule called <strong>AMPK </strong>(adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) that sub­jects cancer  cells to unique metabolic stresses not experienced by healthy tissues.  (Activated <strong>AMPK </strong>promotes death [apoptosis] of malignant cells and  prevents their development.) (Choi 2013; Luo 2010) </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Metformin </strong>independently inhibits <strong>mTOR </strong>(mammalian  target of rapamycin) that regulates cell growth, energy metabolism, cell  motility, cell survival, and protein synthesis (Ben Sahra 2011; Loubière 2013). </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Metformin </strong>mimics the benefits of a hormone called  adiponectin in activating AMPK-dependent growth inhibition in prostate cancer  cells (Zakikhani 2008). </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Metformin </strong>blocks cancer cell reproductive cycles  by decreasing levels of a growth-promoting protein called <strong>cyclin D1</strong> (Ben Sahra 2008). </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Metformin </strong>increases production of a protein (<strong>p27</strong>)  that inhibits the cell division cycle (Ben Sahra 2008).</li>
        <li>
          <strong> Metformin </strong>suppresses <strong>vascular endothelial  growth factor </strong>(VEGF) thereby cutting off the blood supply to tumors (Ersoy  2008). </li>
    </ul>

  </div></div>
<p>At a  cancer conference in early 2013, the results of a study were reported of 22 men  (medi­an age 64, median PSA <strong>6 ng/mL</strong>) with confirmed prostate cancer that  were given <strong>500 mg </strong>of met­formin three times a day 41 days prior to  surgery (prostatectomy). In response to metformin the men showed the expected  reductions in <strong><em>glucose </em></strong>and <strong><em>insulin growth fac­tor-1 (IGF-1) </em></strong>blood  levels, along with <strong>abdominal fat loss</strong> (Joshua 2012). What got the researchers  excited was that compared to biopsied spec­imens, the surgically removed  prostate glands showed a <strong>32% </strong>reduction in a marker of cell pro­liferation  (Ki-67) and a favorable alteration in a pathway tumor cells use to proliferate  out of control (via mTOR) (Carlson 2012). </p>
    <p>Knowledgeable customers  point out that <strong>curcumin </strong>interferes with these tumor growth pathways via  similar mechanisms, which we at <strong><em>Life Extension </em></strong>have long been  familiar with (Ravindran 2009). My argument for  recommending <strong>metformin </strong>is that it should produce potent additive effects  to curcumin. Moreover, we still don’t know what the upper dose limits are for <strong>metformin </strong>and/or <strong>curcumin </strong>for cancer treat­ment, so taking both may have some obvious  advantages. </p>
    <p>Furthermore,  because met­formin is a drug, it tends to get more attention from research­ers,  perhaps because it is easier to obtain funding for drug studies. A European  study published this year showed that metformin was effective against <strong><em>advanced  castra­tion-resistant prostate cancer</em></strong>. The doctors who conducted this  study concluded:</p>
    <p><strong><em>To our  knowledge, our results are the first clinical data to indicate that metformin  use may improve PSA-recurrence free survival, distant metastasis-free survival,  prostate cancer spe­cific mortality, overall survival and reduce the  development of castration resistant prostate cancer in prostate cancer  patients. Further vali­dation of metformin’s potential benefits is warranted</em></strong> (Spratt 2013)<strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
    <p>Interestingly, men  who are on androgen deprivation therapy to treat prostate cancer often show  rising insulin levels that can stim­ulate tumor growth (Currie 2009; Hvid  2013). By tak­ing metformin, some of  the side effects of androgen deprivation therapy can be mitigated, as was shown  in this newly published European study. </p>
    <p>So while nutrients  like <strong>cur­cumin </strong>and <strong>green coffee extract </strong>and others may share  functions that are similar to metformin, we cannot ignore the strong data  showing specific benefits to low-cost <strong>metformin</strong>. </p>
    <p>Another hormone that  pros­tate tumors use to escape eradi­cation is <strong>prolactin</strong> (Dagvadorj 2007), and  this can easily be suppressed by taking <strong>0.25 mg </strong>to <strong>0.5 mg </strong>of  cabergoline (<strong>Dosintex</strong>®) two to three  times weekly (Drugs.com 2013). </p>
    <p><strong>Aspirin </strong>functions  in multi­ple ways to interfere with pros­tate cancer propagation and metastasis  and it may induce genetic changes that facilitate <strong>apoptosis</strong> (Langley 2011). There  is too much data about the potential role of aspirin as an adjuvant cancer  treatment for men with rising PSAs not to use it.</p>

<p>Researchers studied 2,447  men over 12 years, examining them every other year. After adjusting for age,  diabetes, hypertension, and other fac­tors, they found that men who took a  daily aspirin or another NSAID (like ibuprofen) reduced their risk of moderate  or severe urinary symptoms by 27% and lowered their risk of an enlarged  prostate by <strong>47%</strong>. Even more intriguing was the finding  that men who consumed aspirin or another NSAID were <strong>48% </strong>less likely to have an elevated level  of prostate-spe­cific antigen (PSA) (St Sauver 2006). </p>
<p>Aspirin inhibits the cyclooxygenase  (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes, which are also involved in the arachidonic acid  inflammatory path­way (Egan 2006; Wu 2003). COX-2 in particular is known to  promote the proliferation of prostate cancer cells (Xu 2008).</p>

<h2>Treat Yourself As If You Already Have  Prostate Cancer  </h2>
<p>
      This protocol  is supposed to be about prostate cancer prevention, and here I am talking about  ther­apies overlooked by most doctors that may facilitate enhanced treat­ment  outcomes. </p>
    <p>The  reason we can’t ignore <strong>treatments </strong>is that aging men should accept the  reality that in all likelihood there are malignant cells in their prostate  glands now. This makes it easier to consis­tently follow prevention programs  that can reduce the risk that clini­cally diagnosed disease will ever manifest.  It also keeps one on the lookout for non-toxic treatments that may also have  preventative benefits.</p>
    <p>As I have  related in the past, when my PSA reading came back at <strong>1.4 ng/mL </strong>in year <strong>2003</strong>,  I treat­ed it as if I had early stage pros­tate cancer by adopting healthier  dietary choices and taking every nutrient and drug that had shown efficacy in  prostate cancer preven­tion. Ten years later my PSA is <strong>0.4 ng/</strong><strong>mL</strong>. </p>
    <p>I will  remain on an aggressive prostate cancer treatment regimen and in the process  reduce my risk for virtually every other age-relat­ed disease. </p>
    <p>The protocol  provides comprehensive approaches for the prevention of prostate cancer,  including a comprehensive overview demon­strating the <strong>prostate cancer pre­vention </strong>benefits in response to <strong>Avodart® </strong>and <strong>finasteride</strong>. Men with  any type of prostate malig­nancy may also benefit, as the pro­grams we advocate  for <strong>prevention </strong>may also facilitate better overall <strong>treatment</strong>.</p>

<p>The highly variable skills  of the urologist performing TRUSP (tran­srectal ultrasound guided needle biopsy  of the prostate) is of great con­cern when a biopsy is needed. </p>
<p>Too often the urologist  uses the TRUSP to target the prostate gland per se, rather than abnormal areas  within the prostate. Rarely do we see a dedicated TRUSP report that mentions  all of the important find­ings that can and should be related by the urologist  e.g., gland volume, PSA density, status of the capsule and seminal vesicles, as  well as loca­tion of hypoechoic and hyperechoic lesions within the prostate.  Using the TRUSP to target the prostate gland, and not the various lesions  within the gland is akin to diluting a vintage wine with ice cubes. (For  illustration and a description of a model TRUSP report, see Appendix F of the  book <strong><em>A Primer on Prostate Cancer </em></strong>by Strum and Pogliano  available from Life Extension Media by calling <strong>1-800-544-4440 </strong>or log­ging on to www.lifeextension.com) </p>
<p>The varying quality of the  ultrasound device and whether it is a stan­dard <strong><em>gray-scale ultrasound </em></strong>or a <strong><em>color Doppler ultrasound </em></strong>is also significant. <strong>Color Doppler ultrasound</strong>, for instance, discloses patho­logic  states of increased blood vessel growth (angiogenesis) that is associated with  more clinically aggressive prostate cancer, which is often of a higher Gleason  score (Strohmeyer 2001).</p>
<p><strong>MRI </strong>(magnetic resonance  imaging) using <strong>DWI </strong>(diffusion weighted  imaging) will also add to understanding the risk a particular patient with  prostate cancer faces. That’s because when <strong><em>color Doppler ultra­sound </em></strong>is combined with <strong>MRI-DWI</strong>, a predictive value regarding the  level of aggressiveness of the prostate cancer may be established (Ibrahiem  2012). </p>
<p>In this manner, selecting  only those men whose prostate cancers are most likely to be “bad actors” and  who need invasive therapy can be accomplished, while sparing those men with  cancers of low grade, which are often amenable to changes in lifestyle, diet,  and use of sup­plements. </p>

<h2>
    Diverticulosis
</h2>
<p>
    Asymptomatic diverticulosis does not require treatment (Telem 2009; Sopena 2011). However, several preventive measures may reduce the risk that
    diverticulosis will progress to diverticular disease. These include eating a diet high in fiber and low in animal-based foods; getting adequate physical
    activity; not smoking; restricting alcohol intake; limiting use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and opiate painkillers; and maintaining
    a healthy weight (Strate 2012; Bugiantella 2015).
</p>
<h2>
    Uncomplicated Diverticulitis 
</h2>

<p>
    Traditionally, uncomplicated diverticulitis has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and a liquid diet (Ferri 2015). However, the use of
    antibiotics in uncomplicated or mild diverticulitis has recently been called into question because new evidence suggests they may be unnecessary (de Korte
    2011; Hjern 2007; Collins 2015). There is an emerging consensus in the scientific literature that treating mild uncomplicated diverticulitis with
    antibiotics has no benefit in terms of speeding recovery or preventing complications and recurrences (de Korte 2011; Hjern 2007; Collins 2015; Wilkins
    2013).
</p>
<p>
    Recommendations for conservative treatment usually include outpatient management with a liquid or low-residue diet (ie, low in fiber and other foods that
    increase bowel activity such as dairy), sometimes called bowel rest, and oral antibiotics if symptoms persist but do not worsen over three days (Wilkins
    2013; Thaha 2015; Ferri 2015). Surgery is rarely considered necessary for uncomplicated diverticulitis; it is reserved for cases that do not respond to
    medical management, based on individualized risk analysis (Humes 2014; Wilkins 2013).
</p>
<p>
    In light of new evidence and the evolving model of diverticular disease as an inflammatory condition associated with a disturbed bowel flora, newer
    treatments are increasingly being used in mild and uncomplicated cases and to prevent recurrence (Humes 2014). These therapies, including non-systemically
    absorbed antibiotics and probiotics, are described in the Novel and Emerging Therapies and Integrative Interventions sections of this protocol.
</p>
<h2>
    Complicated Diverticulitis
</h2>

<p>
    In complicated diverticulitis, hospitalization with intravenous fluids and antibiotics may be required. A localized abscess may be drained using CT-guided
    percutaneous drainage. Diagnostic imaging is recommended to assess severity and identify complications, which could include abscess, perforation, fistula,
    or stricture (Wilkins 2013).
</p>
<p>
    Surgery is usually reserved for those with abscesses, perforations, fistulas, obstructions, or multiple recurrences, and those who do not respond to
    appropriate medical treatment. Abdominal surgery can be performed either laparoscopically or as traditional open surgery. Bowel resection may be performed,
    though more conservative methods such as laparoscopic intraperitoneal lavage (washing) and percutaneous drainage are increasingly favored, especially for
    low-grade abscesses. These less-invasive procedures result in shorter hospitalizations, fewer complications, and better in-hospital survival (Franklin
    2008; Wilkins 2013; Ferri 2015; Morris 2014; Medina-Fernandez 2015).

"<div><a name=""test"" id=""test""></a> 
  
  
  <p>
    There are now a  number of diagnostic tests to identify early stage prostate cancer and then  monitor the success or failure of a wide range of treatment options.  </p>
  <p>This section  succinctly describes conventional prostate gland diagnostic tests along with  those that mainstream medicine often overlooks, to the detriment of their  patients. All of these tests, however, are commercially available. </p>
  <h2>Tests</h2>
  <h3>PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen)  </h3>
  <p>
    Perhaps the greatest  breakthrough in the detection and management of prostate cancer was the  approval of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test in <strong>1986</strong>, but  it was only approved for men already diag­nosed with prostate cancer (NCI  2012). It wasn’t until <strong>1994 </strong>that the FDA approved the PSA test as a  prostate cancer <strong>screening </strong>test for all men (NCI 2012). Prostate-specific  antigen is a protein produced by the cells of the prostate gland, including  both cancerous cells as well as cells that are benign (NCI 2012). Since very  little PSA escapes into the blood­stream from a healthy prostate, an elevated  PSA level in the blood indicates an abnormal condition of the prostate  gland—which can be either benign or malig­nant. PSA test results can be used  both to detect poten­tial prostate problems and to follow the progress of  prostate cancer therapy (NCI 2012). </p>
  <p>Because tumor growth  is essentially exponential, with one cell dividing into two, two to four, four  to eight, and so on, a tumor cell product such as PSA can reflect such  exponential growth—measuring the time it takes for PSA to double (PSA doubling  time, or PSADT) (Strum 2005). Also, the PSA rate of rise (PSA velocity),  although not a more specific marker, may have value in prostate cancer  prognosis—because men with pros­tate cancer whose PSA level increased by more  than <strong>2.0 ng/mL </strong>during the year before their diagnosis showed a higher  risk of death from prostate cancer (D’Amico 2004). Additionally, though not an  absolute criteria for or against malignancy, PSA velocity can serve as a gauge  regarding the likelihood of a malignant condition (Strum 2005). A rising PSA  velocity in excess of <strong>.75 ng/mL/year </strong>relates to an increased probability  of a malignant condition (Strum 2005). </p>
  <p>The reference  interval provided by most conven­tional laboratories for the PSA test is <strong>0.00-4.00  nano­grams per milliliter (ng/mL) </strong>(LabCorp  2013a). Conventional reference ranges suggest that PSA levels under <strong>4.0  ng/mL </strong>are normal, but any reading over <strong>2.0 ng/mL </strong>can indicate  unhealthy activity, such as prostatitis, benign prostate hypertrophy, or  prostate cancer (Strum 2005). If PSA readings begin to elevate, there are  interventions that can reduce or stabilize the  production of PSA, shutting down a mechanism used by cancer cells to escape  their con­finement within the prostate gland (Webber 1995). PSA readings can  increase immediately after ejaculation, returning slowly to baseline levels  within 24-48 hours (Tchetgen 1996; Herschman 1997).</p>

  <h3>Free PSA </h3>
  <p>
    Free PSA is a  newer evaluation for prostate health. Most PSA in the blood is bound to serum  proteins, but a small amount is not protein-bound and is called free PSA (Strum  2005; Gion 1997). In men with prostate cancer, the ratio of free (unbound) PSA  to total PSA is decreased (Strum 2005). The <strong>free PSA </strong>test  measures the percentage of free PSA relative to the total amount (Abrahamsson  1997). The lower the ratio, the greater the probability of prostate cancer.  Measuring free PSA may help eliminate unnecessary biopsies (Gion 1997). Free  PSA readings increase immediately after ejacula­tion, returning slowly to  baseline levels within about 24 hours (Tchetgen 1996). Although not used as an  initial screening test, a lower percentage of free PSA might mean your  doctor needs to do a further workup.</p>
<p>
    Below are  the percentage of PSA ranges and what they represent as far as prostate cancer  risk. Note that when the percentage of free PSA is high (over <strong>20%</strong>), this  means the risk of prostate cancer is low, whereas a low percentage of free PSA  (under <strong>11% </strong>indicates high risk). </p>

  <h3>PCA3 Urine </h3>
  <p>
    PCA3 is a  molecular diagnostic test performed on urine rather than blood and detects mRNA  that is excreted into the urethra via the epithelial cells that line the  prostatic ducts (Hessels 2009). Prostate cancer cells tend to produce this  compound far more than normal cells do (Hessels 2009). The PCA3 urine test has  to be done in a urolo­gist’s, or other doctor’s, office, because it requires a  digital rectal massage just prior to collection of the urine (Day 2011). </p>
  <p>PCA3 testing is  most useful when repeated over a period of time to monitor for changes in the  observed value. In general, a PCA3 score of <strong>35 </strong>is considered the optimal  cut-off. A score of greater than <strong>35 </strong>reflects an increased probability of  a positive biopsy. A score of less than <strong>35 </strong>reflects a decreased  probability of a positive biopsy.</p>
  <h3> 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D </h3>
  <p>
    Research points  to a connection between vitamin D levels and cancer (Qin 2013; van den Bemd  2002). Experimental studies indicate that low levels of vitamin D increase  prostate cancer risk (Lou 2004). And further evidence shows that the active  form of vitamin D promotes differentiation and inhibits proliferation,  invasiveness, and metastasis of human prostate cancer cells (Lou 2004; John  2005). Detecting deficient levels allows you and your physician to implement  vitamin D supplementation to help avert illnesses associated with inadequate  vitamin D levels. For this nutrient, individualized dosing is of particular  importance, and the only way to accomplish this is through vitamin D blood  testing. Although conventional laboratory refer­ence ranges list a reference  interval of <strong>30-100 ng/mL</strong>, Life Extension supports maintaining vitamin D  in the <strong>50-80 ng/mL </strong>range (LabCorp 2013b).</p>
  <h3> Prolactin  </h3>
  <p>
    Prolactin,  a peptide hormone largely secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, has  typically remained restricted to the fields of lactation and infertility.  However, researchers discovered that prolactin plays a major role in the  differentiation and development of the prostate gland (Sethi 2012). Both  malignant and healthy prostates produce prolactin. Prostatic fluids from  patients with cancer also have higher prolactin levels than controls (Sethi  2012). In vitro, prolactin induces prolifera­tion and antagonizes apoptosis in  prostate organ cul­ture and in some tumor cell lines (Sethi 2012). Increased  levels of prolactin have significant stimulatory action on the prostate and on  prostate ductal development and may lead to hyperplastic growth, independent of  elevations in circulating androgen levels (Kindblom 2003). </p>

  <h3>DRE (Digital Rectal Exam)  </h3>
  <p>
    Men can easily  be tested for palpable prostate abnormalities with a digital rectal exam (DRE),  a sim­ple test that provides a lot of information (Tisman 2001). It gives the  physician a sense of the prostate gland volume. The bigger the prostate, the  more PSA the gland is entitled to make without indicating a potential problem.  A basic rule is that the prostate gland volume multiplied by the amount of PSA  produced per unit of volume in benign prostate tissue is <strong>0.067 ng</strong> (Tisman 2001). This means that a 50-year old man with a normal size prostate  of <strong>30 grams </strong>(or cubic centimeters) would therefore be entitled to make  approximately <strong>2 ng </strong>of PSA. If such a man has a PSA of <strong>4.0 ng/mL</strong>,  it would indicate an excess of about <strong>2 ng </strong>of PSA and the need for  further investigation to rule out prostate cancer.</p>
<p>
    In addition to  estimating prostate gland volume and calculating the benign cellular  contribution to the total PSA value, the DRE can also aid in finding hard  nodules or other evidence of disease. Palpable (able to be felt) abnormalities  of the prostate gland relate to tumor volume, also called tumor burden (Tisman  2001). In the years before routine testing with PSA, most prostate cancers were  already palpable via DRE by the time of diagnosis. Today, close to <strong>70% </strong>of  prostate cancers newly diagnosed in the US are no longer associated with  palpable disease (Tisman 2001). This shows the value of PSA screening in  allowing an earlier diagnosis of pros­tate cancer — before the cancer has had a  chance to get bulkier and manifest itself as a palpable disease, known as a T2  disease. Most American men when first diagnosed with prostate cancer have  non-palpable, or T1, prostate cancer (Tisman 2001).</p>
    <h3> Blood Hormone Profile  </h3>
  <p>
    A comprehensive  blood test for specific hormone levels is useful. In addition to the free and  total tes­tosterone levels covered earlier, a complete blood test should  include levels of estradiol, DHT (dihydrotestos­terone), pregnenolone, DHEA-S  (dehydroepiandros­terone sulfate), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), LH  (luteinizing hormone), and possibly, IGF-1 (insu­lin-like growth factor 1). DHT  plays a role in the development and exacerbation of benign prostatic  hyperplasia, as well as prostate cancer (NCI 2013c). FSH (follicle-stimulating  hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) regulate the reproductive processes of  the body, and in aging men, a rise in FSH and LH can be indicative of  andropause (Dandona 2010; Miwa 2006). Studies have shown that increased levels  of IGF promote cancer growth and confer resis­tance to conventional treatments  (chemotherapy and radiation) (Arnaldez 2012; Kojima 2009).</p>
  <h3> PAP (Prostatic Acid Phosphatase) Test  </h3>
  <p>
    The PAP test is  a simple blood test, used to measure the amount of an enzyme—called prostatic  acid phos­phatase (PAP)—that is produced by prostate epithelial cells and is  abundant in seminal fluid (Kong 2013). Higher levels of PAP are associated with  prostate cancer (Kong 2013). PAP deter­mination, in conjunction with PSA  measurements, is useful in assessing the prognosis of prostate cancer. It is an  important test, because it allows identification of prostate cancer patients  who have an elevation of PAP, but not of PSA. This helps monitor the course of  disease and response to treatment.</p>

  <h3>Circulating Tumor Cells Assay  </h3>
  <p>
    This test provides a measurement of cancer cells that  have separated from a solid tumor site and are circulating in the bloodstream  (Ligthart 2013). Detecting the pres­ence of circulating tumor cells in the  blood has clinical usefulness in assessing the disease status and progno­sis of  metastatic prostate cancer, and is predictive of overall survival (Miller  2010). Fasting prior to the blood draw is not required.</p>
  <h2>Imaging </h2>
  <h3>Transrectal Ultrasound  </h3>
  <p>
    Transrectal  ultrasound creates an image of the organs in the pelvis, and the most common  indica­tion is for the evaluation of the prostate gland in men with elevated  PSA levels, or with prostatic nodules on a digital rectal exam (UPMC 2013).  Ultrasound clarifies the size of the prostate gland and aids in the distinction  between benign prostate conditions and prostate cancer (UPMC 2013). This type  of imaging can also be used to help guide a biopsy of the prostate (UPMC 2013).</p>
    <img alt=""Transrectal  ultrasound"" src=""/protocols/images/pc_prevention/dec2013_pdaat_06.jpg"" border=""0"">

  <h3>Color Doppler Ultrasound  </h3>
  <p>
    Color  Doppler ultrasound is a medical imaging technique that is used to provide  visualization of blood flow, using computer processing to add color to the  image to greatly clarify what is happening inside the body (WebMD 2010). An  ultrasound transducer is used to beam sound into the area of interest, and it  reads the return­ing sound. When the sound bounces off a moving tar­get such as  a blood vessel, the pitch changes as a result of the Doppler effect. The  transducer can detect very subtle pitch changes, record them visually, and gen­erate  an image showing where blood is flowing, and in what direction. Because a  simple grayscale image can be a bit difficult to read, the ultrasound machine  assigns different color values, depending on whether blood is moving towards or  away from the transducer. In addition to showing the direction of flow, the col­ors  also vary in intensity depending on the velocity of the flow, allowing doctors  to also see how quickly the blood is moving (UPMC 2013). </p>
  <p>A color Doppler  ultrasound of a patient with a sus­pected tumor will reveal the precise areas  where the velocity of blood flow is changing, mapping out the problem in full  color (Fleischer 2000). This type of imaging can map out the tumor’s blood  supply to clarify exactly how far the growth has spread (PCRI 2011). This can  have an impact on what treatments are selected, and how surgery and other  measures are approached. While color Doppler ultrasound can be done using a  transducer on the out­side of the body, it can also be used for transrectal  procedures, in which the probe is inserted to get a bet­ter view.</p>
  <h3> MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)  </h3>
  <p>
    The MRI has been  used for over 30 years for pros­tate cancer detection and evaluation (Gupta RT  2013). In contrast to ultrasound imaging, prostate MRI has superior soft tissue  resolution (UCCM 2013). Magnetic fields are used to locate and characterize  prostate cancer. To do so, radiolo­gists use multi-parametric MRI, which  includes four different types of MRI sequences (Gupta RT 2013). Currently, MRI  is used to identify targets for prostate biopsy, and to make a surgical plan  for men undergoing robotic pros­tatectomy. MRI imaging also helps surgeons  decide whether to resect or spare the neurovascular bundle and assess surgical  difficulty (Gupta RT 2013).</p>
  <h3> (Nuclear) Bone Scan  </h3>
  <p>
    Prostate  cancer can cause “hot spots” to appear on a bone scan if the cancer has  metastasized to the bone (ACS 2013a; Tombal 2012). A bone scan for cancer uses  nuclear tech­nology and involves administering a radioactive substance called a  tracer to produce gamma radia­tion that can be picked up by a special camera  (ACS 2013a). The tracer consists of radionuclides that bind to the bone and  show up as dark or light spots. After the techni­cian injects the tracer, it  usually takes between one and four hours for the radioactive substance to move  throughout the skeleton. During this time, patients will be asked to drink up  to six glasses of water to flush any tracer material not absorbed by bone.  Then, the patient must remain still on a padded table while a large camera  passes over the body. </p>
  <p>A dark spot,  also called a cold spot, might indicate lack of absorption of the tracer (ACS  2013a). This may also indi­cate that cancer has spread to the bone from the  pros­tate gland. A normal scan shows evenly distributed tracer throughout the  body. Risks associated with a bone scan are considered low, with a very small  level of radiation exposure (ACS 2013a). The radionuclides injected into the  bloodstream are excreted through the urine and have a low risk of toxicity (ACS  2013a).</p>
  <h3> Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT)  </h3>
  <p>
    Osteoporosis, or  bone thinning, is associated with prostate cancer and can be a side effect of  prostate cancer treatment (Tuck 2013). Quantitative computed tomogra­phy (QCT)  is a highly sensitive test that is better able to determine bone density  changes than common meth­ods such as DEXA testing (Smith 2001). Studies have  shown that DEXA testing can often read degenerative changes involving bone and  joint tissues and calcium deposits within blood vessels as bone density thus  not suggest­ing osteoporosis when in fact bone loss is present (Bolotin 2001;  Meirelles 1999; von der Recke 1996; AHRQ 2011). Quantitative computed  tomography (QCT) is similar to other forms of computed tomography (CT). As with  any CT scan, an X-ray tube and sensor rotate around the body area in a circular  or spiral pattern, and a series of pictures are transmitted to a computer  (Feretti 1999). The primary difference with QCT is the special analysis  performed by special QCT software. While most computed tomog­raphy (CT)  software produces a composite visual image to detect fractures or other  symptoms in the scanned bone or soft tissue, QCT uses the data provided by the  scanner to generate numerical values for the volume, mass, and density of bone  (Feretti 1999). This allows QCT to distin­guish between cortical bone, which  lines the outside of the bones, and trabecular bone, the softer tissue that  makes up the center of the bone (IDI 2013). Trabecular bone is much more  metabolically active than cortical bone—meaning, the two types of bone are  replaced at different rates (IDI 2013). As a result, these two bone types can  show dif­ferent rates of change in bone mineral density.</p>
  <h2>Genetic Testing</h2>
  <p>About  half of US men diagnosed with prostate can­cer are classified as low-risk by  use of conventional measures such as Gleason Score (a form of tumor grading),  the prostate-specific antigen test (PSA), and a physical exam (Genomic Health  2013). Nonetheless, nearly <strong>90% </strong>of these low-risk patients will choose to  undergo immediate aggressive treatment such as radical prostatectomy or  radiation even though there is less than a <strong>3% </strong>chance of deadly  progression (Genomic Health 2013). </p>
  <p>A new  test called <strong>Oncotype DX </strong>is now available to physicians and their  patients. It measures the level of expression of <strong>17 genes </strong>across four  biological path­ways to predict prostate cancer aggressiveness (Genomic Health  2013). </p>
  <p>Test results are  reported as a <strong>Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) </strong>ranging from <strong>0 to 100</strong>;  this score is assessed along with other clinical factors to clarify a man’s  risk prior to treatment intervention (Genomic Health 2013). This multi-gene  test has been validated using the pros­tate needle biopsy sample taken <em>before </em>the prostate is removed, thereby providing the opportunity for low risk  patients to avoid invasive treatments. According to the principle investigator  of the validation study, individual biological information from the Oncotype DX  prostate cancer test almost <strong>tripled </strong>the number of patients who can more  confidently consider active surveillance and avoid unnecessary treatment and  its potential side effects (Genomic Health 2013).</p>
<p>
    The  advantage of this test for those who choose the <strong><em>comprehensive  surveillance program </em></strong>utilized by Life Extension customers (which involves  the use of several drugs, targeted nutrients, and adherence to healthy dietary  patterns) is to provide greater assurance the right course of action is being  followed. </p>

  <p><strong>Prolaris® </strong>is another genomic test developed to aid physicians in predicting  prostate cancer aggressive­ness in conjunction with clinical parameters such as  Gleason score and PSA (Myriad 2013). </p>
  <p>Prolaris<strong>® </strong>measures prostate cancer tumor biology at the molecular level. By measuring  and analyzing the level of expression of genes directly involved with cancer  replication, Prolaris® may be able to more accu­rately predict disease  progression (Myriad 2013). </p>
  <p>Prolaris<strong>® </strong>is a tool designed to measure the aggres­siveness of a patient’s cancers to  better predict and stratify an individual’s relative risk of disease progres­sion  within ten years (Myriad 2013). It may enable physicians to better define a  treatment/monitoring strategy for their patients. </p>
  <p>Prolaris<strong>® </strong>claims to be significantly more prognos­tic than currently used variables  and provides unique additional information that can be combined with other  clinical factors in an attempt to make a more accurate prediction of a  patient’s cancer aggressive­ness and therefore disease progression (Myriad  2013). </p>
  <p>Prolaris<strong>® </strong>has been shown to predict clinical pro­gression in four different clinical  cohorts, in both pre and post-treatment scenarios. </p>
  <p>In the  treatment of prostate cancer, Prolaris<strong>® </strong>is prognostic at the point of  diagnosis and in the post-surgery setting (Myriad 2013). </p>
  <p>At  diagnosis, Prolaris<strong>® </strong>can help to identify patients with less aggressive  cancer who may be candidates for active surveillance. In addition, Prolaris<strong>® </strong>can define patients who appear clinically low-risk but have a more  aggressive disease that requires more aggressive treatment. </p>
  <p>Prolaris<strong>® </strong>testing is also well suited for use in post-prostatectomy patients that  have higher risk features after surgery to better estimate their risk of  disease recurrence and therefore adjust the level of monitor­ing or add  additional therapy. </p>

  <h2> Summary </h2>
  <p>Prostate  cancer is the most common malignancy in US men (excluding non-melanoma skin  cancer), afflicting one male in every six (Siegel 2012; PCF 2013b). A  significant per­centage of men have underlying prostate cancer with­out even  knowing it (Harvei 1999; Billis 1986; Sakr 1995). </p>
  <p>These men  have access to an arsenal of tools for their doctors to diagnose and then  monitor the success or failure of various treatment modalities, including  “active surveillance” or “watchful waiting.” </p>
  <p>As you’ll learn  in this protocol,  one does not have to sit back and “watch” their PSA level steadily rise.  Nutritional, hormonal, and drug approaches exist to help control early-stage,  low-grade prostate tumors. There is data to support the efficacy of some of  them as effective adjuvants in men with high-grade tumors as well  (Gallardo-Williams 2004; Choi 2010; Dorai 2001; Fleshner 1999; Yang Y 2007;  McCann 2008; von Holtz 1998; Zaidman 2007; Thirugnanam 2008).</p>

<h2>
    Fecal Calprotectin Testing
</h2>
<p>
    Calprotectin is a protein released from white blood cells during inflammation. Fecal calprotectin, a non-invasive stool test, is under investigation as a
    biomarker that may help identify diverticular disease. Fecal calprotectin can distinguish inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn’s or ulcerative
    colitis, from functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Fecal calprotectin is also being investigated as a biomarker for colorectal
    cancer and as a clinical tool in patients with inflammatory bowel disease to identify risk of relapse (Burri 2014; Henderson 2014; Fengming 2014).
</p>
<p>
    Two studies have found that fecal calprotectin is higher in active diverticular disease than in healthy individuals and those with IBS. In asymptomatic
    diverticulosis, however, fecal calprotectin was not elevated; and in segmental colitis associated with diverticula (SCAD) it was higher than in other types
    of diverticular disease. In these studies, treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis and symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD)
    reduced fecal calprotectin to normal levels (Tursi 2009; Tursi 2011).
</p>
<p>
    Persistently high fecal calprotectin may indicate a high risk of recurrence. In one study, 54 people were followed for an average of 20 months after a bout
    of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis; seven of the eight people who had a recurrence during the study had elevated fecal calprotectin, while only one
    person who experienced a recurrence had normal fecal calprotectin (Tursi, Elisei, Picchio 2014).
</p>
<p>
    Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest fecal calprotectin may distinguish diverticular disease from IBS; help monitor severity of
    diverticulitis and response to treatment; and predict risk of disease recurrence (Tursi, Elisei 2015; Tursi 2009; Erbayrak 2009).
</p>
<h2>
    Rifaximin
</h2>

<p>
    Rifaximin (Xifaxan) is an antibiotic that is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream and so has a favorable safety profile (Gold Standard 2014). Rifaximin
    targets the microbial community in the gut and has been studied for the treatment of SUDD (Sopena 2011; Strate, Modi 2012). A comprehensive literature
    review analyzed four randomized controlled trials that compared treatment of SUDD using fiber supplementation plus seven days per month of rifaximin with
    fiber supplementation alone. This analysis found that rifaximin was associated with better symptom relief, fewer complications, and a better chance of
    being symptom-free after one year (Bianchi 2011).
</p>
<p>
    An interesting study in 40 patients with uncomplicated diverticular disease found that rifaximin treatment reduced the interaction of gut bacteria with
    specialized receptors on immune cells, called toll-like receptors, which are involved in the induction of the inflammatory immune response to
    microorganisms. This study showed that rifaximin reduced the activation of toll-like receptors, thereby reducing gut inflammation. These findings prompted
    the researchers who conducted the study to postulate that rifaximin might have anti-inflammatory activity in the gut lining, as well as systemic
    immune-modulating effects, through its impact on pathogenic microbes residing in the gut (Cianci 2014).
</p>
<h2>
    Mesalamine
</h2>

<p>
    Mesalamine (also called mesalazine) (Asacol) belongs to a class of medications that contain 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), which have anti-inflammatory and
    free radical-scavenging effects. Medications in this drug class are used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (CCFA 2013; Tursi 2014; Thaha
    2015). Mesalamine has also been studied in diverticular disease (Thaha 2015; Collins 2015; Morris 2014). One rigorous review of the scientific literature
    examined six randomized controlled trials of 5-ASA medications for uncomplicated diverticulitis in a total of 818 patients, and found that these
    medications led to significantly better outcomes than placebo (Gatta 2010).
</p>
<p>
    A randomized controlled trial in 117 patients who had acute diverticulitis found that the rate of complete response, in which patients became asymptomatic,
    was significantly higher in patients receiving mesalamine than in those who received placebo (Stollman 2013). Additional rigorous studies are needed to
    clarify the role of mesalamine in the treatment of diverticular disease.

<h2>
    Plant-Based, Fiber-Rich Diet
</h2>
<p>
    Plant-based diets that are high in fiber may protect against diverticular disease. The study of fiber as it relates to diverticular disease often focuses
    on fiber’s role in promoting bowel regularity (Collins 2015). However, fiber may also influence the risk of diverticular disease via its role as a
    prebiotic, meaning it provides fuel for beneficial probiotic organisms. Also, fiber promotes the formation of short-chain fatty acids, notably butyrate,
    which are essential for colonic health. In fact, butyrate has been studied as a treatment for diverticular disease (Slavin 2013; Krokowicz, Stojcev 2014).
</p>
<p>
    In a study that monitored over 47 000 men and women for an average of 11.6 years, vegetarians had a 31% lower risk and vegans had a 72% lower risk of
    diverticular disease compared with meat eaters. This study also noted a link between increased dietary fiber and lower risk of diverticular disease in both
    meat eaters and non-meat eaters (Crowe 2011). And in a study in more than 43 000 people, the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease was reduced by 45% in
    those with the highest intake of insoluble fiber, compared with those who had the lowest intake (Aldoori 1998).
</p>
<p>
    Some, though not all, trials have found a beneficial effect of a high-fiber diet or fiber supplements on diverticular disease symptoms (Unlu 2012), and
    many practice guidelines call for a high fiber intake or fiber supplementation for the prevention and treatment of symptomatic diverticular disease (Cuomo
    2014; Andersen 2012; Thaha 2015).
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Note: A <u>low-fiber</u>, low-residue diet is often recommended during the initial healing phase after an episode of acute diverticulitis (Mayo Clinic
        2014b; Saul 2015; Thaha 2015). People recovering from an episode of acute diverticulitis should ask their healthcare provider about consuming fiber.
    </em>
</p>
<h2>
    Nuts, Corn, and Popcorn
</h2>
<p>
    Historically, diverticular disease management has included the avoidance of foods with large indigestible pieces such as nuts, seeds, corn, and popcorn.
    The belief behind this recommendation was that fragments of these foods could become trapped in diverticula and cause inflammation and infection. However,
    a study in over 47 000 American male health professionals found no association between consumption of these foods and diverticulitis risk. In fact, this
    study found that men who ate nuts or popcorn two or more times per week had 20% and 28% <em>reduced</em> risk of diverticulitis, respectively, compared
    with men who ate those foods less than once per month (Strate 2008).
</p>
<h2>
    Physical Activity
    and Weight Management
</h2>
<p>
    Physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight may reduce the incidence of diverticular disease and its complications. In an 18-year study in over
    47 000 American male health professionals, those who reported exercising the most were 25% less likely to develop diverticular disease and 46% less likely
    to have diverticular bleeding than those who reported exercising the least. Vigorous activity was especially correlated with a significantly lower risk of
    diverticular disease and bleeding (Strate, Liu, Aldoori, Giovannucci 2009). A study in over 36 500 women found that those who reported low levels of
    exercise­­—30 minutes or less per day—had a 53% higher risk of diverticular disease compared with women who exercised more than 30 minutes per day (Hjern
    2012). Another study that followed more than 10 000 joggers aged 50 or older for 7.7 years found that more running was associated with less diverticular
    disease, and more vigorous and longer runs were more protective (Williams 2009).
</p>
<p>
    Also, excess weight, especially when carried around the abdomen, appears to be a risk factor for diverticular disease and its complications. A study in
    over 47 000 male US health professionals found that, compared with normal-weight men, obese men had a greater than 1.7-fold higher risk of diverticulitis
    and a 3.1-fold higher risk of diverticular bleeding; men with the largest waist circumference, compared with those with the lowest, had a greater than
    1.5-fold higher risk of diverticulitis and greater than 1.9-fold higher risk of diverticular bleeding (Strate, Liu, Aldoori, Syngal 2009). Another study in
    women found that overweight and obese women had a 29% and 33% increased risk, respectively, of diverticular disease compared with normal-weight women; and
    obese women had double the risk for complicated diverticular disease (Hjern 2012).

"<div><a name=""mortality"" id=""mortality""></a>
<p>If the information you are about to read could be turned into a patented drug, it would be worth billions of dollars of annual sales to whoever owned it. </p>
<p>What’s regrettable is very few doctors provide this lifesaving data to their prostate cancer patients. A staggering number of lives could be spared if the dietary changes discussed in this protocol are widely implemented. </p>
<p>In the February 2007 issue of Life Extension magazine, we published an article titled “Eating Your Way to Prostate Cancer.” </p>
<p>In the April 2003 issue, we published an article titled “Eating Food Cooked at High Temperature Accelerates Aging.” </p>
<p>Since these articles were published, large numbers of confirmative studies have been conducted that substantiate what we warned about. </p>
<p>This section will describe recently published science showing how eating the wrong foods markedly increase one’s risk of developing prostate cancer. </p>
<p>It also reveals data showing that men already diagnosed with prostate cancer who consume the wrong foods progress to advanced disease and death faster. <strong></strong></p>
<p>Cancer cells are present in the prostate glands of many aging men, yet only one in six men are ever diagnosed with prostate cancer (ACS 2013e; Roehrborn 2006). If one looks at what is required for a single cancer cell to develop into a detectable tumor, it becomes obvious that natural barriers exist to protect men against full-blown cancer. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, dietary choices in the Western world circumvent the body’s protective barriers (Erdelyi 2009). The end result is that most men unwittingly provide, through their <strong>food </strong>choices, biological fuel for existing prostate cancer cells to propagate and metastasize. </p>
<p>An understanding of the biological roles of diet and specific nutrients can enable aging men to achieve a considerable amount of control over whether isolated cancer cells in their prostate gland will ever show up as a clinically diagnosed disease. </p>
<p>The impact of the food we ingest on cell growth and death is so pronounced that it can be similar to the effects displayed by anticancer drugs—without the toxicities. </p>
<h2>Don’t Eat Overcooked Meat </h2>
<p>Any meat (including fish) cooked at high temperatures creates dangerous carcinogens (NCI 2010). Scientists looked at men whose diets included high intake of <strong>red meat </strong>cooked at high temperatures, pan-fried, or well-done. Their findings published in <strong>2012 </strong>showed specific <strong><em>gene expression </em></strong>changes that predisposed these men to <strong>advanced </strong>prostate cancer (Joshi 2012). These kinds of studies show that one can exert a degree of control over their cell regulatory <strong><em>genes </em></strong>by avoiding overcooked meats. </p>
<p>Aggressive malignancies are those that rapidly propagate, infiltrate and metastasize (NCI 2013b). A <strong>2011 </strong>study evaluated almost 1,000 men and found that higher consumption of any ground beef or processed meats was associated with an increased risk of <strong>aggressive </strong>prostate cancer (Punnen 2011). Men who ate ground beef showed the strongest association with a <strong>130% </strong>increased incidence. The association primarily reflected intake of grilled or barbequed meat, with more well-done meat conferring a higher risk of <strong>aggressive prostate cancer</strong>. In contrast, consumption of rare/medium cooked ground beef was not associated with aggressive prostate cancer (Punnen 2011). </p>
<p>A <strong>2011 </strong>study looked at dietary patterns of 726 newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases and compared them to 527 controls (John 2011). For advanced prostate cancer (but not localized disease), there was an associated <strong>79% </strong>increased risk in men who ate hamburgers, a <strong>57% </strong>increased risk with processed meats, a <strong>63% </strong>increased risk with grilled red meat, and a <strong>52% </strong>increased risk with well-done red meat (John 2011). This study corroborated others associating consumption of processed meat and red meat, especially when cooked at <strong><em>high temperatures</em></strong>, with increased cases of <strong>advanced prostate cancer </strong>(Joshi 2012; NCI 2013b). </p>
<h2>Concern About Eggs and Milk </h2>
<p>Large-scale studies associate egg consumption with sharply increased cancer risks (Richman 2011; Aune 2009). </p>
<p>A <strong>2011 </strong>study looked at <strong>27,607 </strong>men who developed or died from prostate cancer over a 14-year period (Richman 2011). Men who consumed <strong>2.5 </strong>or more eggs per week had an <strong>81% </strong>increased risk of lethal prostate cancer compared to those who consumed less than half an egg per week (Richman 2011). This study showed that consumption of eggs increased the risk of healthy men developing metastatic prostate cancer. </p>
<p>A <strong>2013 </strong>evaluation was done using data from the famous <strong>Physician’s Health Study </strong>to identify the impact of consumption of skim or whole milk on incidence and survival after diagnosis of prostate cancer (Song 2013). This analysis involved 21,660 physicians who were followed for 28 years. Skim/low fat milk was associated with increased risk of low grade prostate cancer, whereas whole milk was associated with increased risk of <strong>fatal </strong>prostate cancers. In these men diagnosed with prostate cancer, consumption of whole milk was associated with a <strong>117% </strong>increased risk of progression to fatal disease (Song 2013). This finding further substantiates the important role of diet even after prostate cancer is diagnosed. </p>
<p>The take-home lesson so far is if one has an elevated or rising PSA, it is especially prudent to avoid over cooked red meats, processed meat, eggs, and whole cow’s milk. </p>
<h2>Confusion About Omega-6 Fats </h2>
<p><strong>Omega-6 fats </strong>are essential to life. We are unable to make them in our body and must get them from foods (UMMC 2013b). </p>
<p>The problem is that Western diets have become so overloaded with <strong><em>omega-6s </em></strong>that our bodies have become poisoned with them. The typical American tends to consume up to 25 times more omega-6 fats than the healthier omega-3 fats (UMMC 2013b). </p>
<p>One reason we have become so overloaded with <strong>omega-6s </strong>is that in the rush to switch from <strong>red meat </strong>and other <strong>saturated fats </strong>such as lard, we have been gobbling down too many <strong>omega-6-rich </strong>foods. These include vegetable oils used in all kinds of processed and fried foods, margarine, salad dressing, mayonnaise, certain nuts, peanut butter, and even poultry, a meat with high omega-6 content (SELF 2012). `</p>
<p>Commercial food companies deceivingly promote polyunsaturated vegetable oils like corn and safflower as healthy because of early studies showing reduced cardiovascular risk factors in those who consumed vegetable oils compared to animal-based fats such as butter (Mekki 2002). </p>
<p>Remember that you require omega-6s to live, but not in the large <strong><em>quantity </em></strong>consumed in the typical American diet. This means you want to lower the percentage of calories in your diet that comprise of <strong><em>omega-6 </em></strong>fats. </p>
<p>Table 1 lists foods high in omega-6 fats. Eating any of these foods in moderation is not a problem, but when they comprise a high percentage of your overall diet, your body becomes overloaded with <strong><em>omega-6s</em></strong><em>, </em>which sets the stage for a wide variety of disorders. We next describe how a high intake of omega-6 fats contributes to prostate cancer.</p>

<h2>Role of Omega-6 Fats in Prostate Cancer </h2>
<p>Diets high in <strong>omega-6 fats </strong>and <strong>saturated fats </strong>are associated with <strong><em>greater </em></strong>prostate cancer risk, whereas increased intake of the type of <strong>omega-3 fats </strong>found in fish has been shown to confer protection (Newcomer 2001; Leitzmann 2004; Pelser 2013). </p>
<p>Based on consistent epidemiological findings across a wide range of human populations, scientists have sought to understand why eating the wrong kinds of fat (saturated and omega-6 fats) provokes a stimulatory effect on prostate cancer (Newcomer 2001; Pelser 2013). </p>
<p>To ascertain what happens after we eat bad fats, all one has to do is look at the metabolic breakdown pathways that these fats follow in the body, as shown in Figure 1. For example, let us assume that for dinner, you eat a steak (a source of saturated fat), potato (a high-glycemic starch) and a salad with a typical dressing of soybean and/or safflower oils (omega-6 fats). </p>
<p>As can be seen in the flow chart, omega-6 fats can convert to <strong><em>arachidonic acid </em></strong>in the body. Meat itself contains arachidonic acid (Sears 2011). One way that the body rids itself of <em>excess </em>arachidonic acid is by provoking a dangerous metabolizing pathway through <strong><em>5-lipoxygenase </em></strong>(5-LOX). </p>
<p>It is well established that <strong>5-LOX </strong>products stimulate prostate cancer cell proliferation via several well-defined mechanisms (Hassan 2006; Moreti 2004; Ghosh 1998). High glycemic foods also promote formation of 5-LOX in the body, via activation of enzymes involved in the formation of arachidonic acid (Sears 2011). </p>
<p><strong>Arachidonic acid</strong>, found abundantly in eggs and chicken, is metabolized by the <strong><em>5-LOX enzyme </em></strong>to <strong><em>5</em></strong>-<strong><em>hydroxyeicosatetraeonic acid </em></strong>(5-HETE), a potent survival factor that prostate cancer cells use to escape destruction (Sears 2011; Ghosh 1998; Sundaram 2006). The flow chart (Figure 1) clearly demonstrates how consuming a diet rich in <strong><em>arachidonic acid </em></strong>provokes the production of dangerous <strong>5-LOX </strong>products, which can promote prostate cancer progression (Sears 2011; Hassan 2006; Moretti 2004; Ghosh 1997; Ghosh 1998; Sundaram 2006). In addition to 5-HETE, 5-LOX also metabolizes arachidonic acid to <strong>leukotriene B4 </strong>and other pro-inflammatory agents that promote cancer (Larré 2008).</p>
<p>The chart (Table 1) provides a long list of foods that are high in <strong><em>arachidonic acid. </em></strong>Just because a food is listed on this chart does not mean you have to avoid it. It is wise, however, to pick which high-arachidonic acid foods are that important compared to ones you may not even realize you’re consuming. </p>
<img alt=""list of foods that are high in arachidonic acid"" src=""/protocols/images/pc_prevention/dec2013_iodopcram_05.jpg"" border=""0""> <p>Flow chart showing how the body metabolizes common foods via a 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathway. </p>
<h2>5-LOX Is Over-Expressed in Prostate Cancer </h2>
<p>Based on studies showing that consumption of foods rich in omega 6 fatty acids is associated with higher incidences of prostate cancer, scientists sought to determine how much of the 5-LOX enzyme is present in malignant versus benign prostate tissues (Ritch 2007). </p>
<p>Using biopsy samples taken from living human patients, the researchers found that 5-LOX mRNA levels were an astounding <strong>six-fold greater </strong>in malignant prostate tissues compared with benign tissues. This study also found that levels of 5-HETE were <strong>2.2-fold greater </strong>in malignant versus benign prostate tissues (Gupta I 2001). The scientists concluded this study by stating that selective inhibitors of <strong>5-LOX </strong>may be useful in the prevention or treatment of patients with prostate cancer (Gupta I 2001). </p>
<h2>5-LOX Promotes Tumor Growth Factors </h2>
<p>As the evidence mounts that ingesting “bad fats” increases prostate cancer risk, scientists are evaluating the effects of 5-LOX on various growth factors involved in the progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis of cancer cells. </p>
<p>One study found that 5-LOX activity is required to stimulate prostate cancer cell growth by <strong><em>epidermal growth factor </em></strong>(EGF) and other tumor cell proliferating factors produced in the body (Hassan 2006). When <strong>5-LOX </strong>levels were reduced, the cancer cell stimulatory effect of EGF and other growth factors was diminished (Hassan 2006). </p>
<p>In a mouse study, an increase in 5-LOX resulted in a corresponding increase in <strong><em>vascular endothelial growth factor </em></strong>(VEGF), a key growth factor that tumor cells use to stimulate new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) into the tumor. <strong>5-LOX inhibitors </strong>have been shown to reduce tumor angiogenesis along with a host of other growth factors (Ye 2004). </p>
<p>In both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines, the inhibition of <strong>5-LOX </strong>has consistently been shown to halt the growth stimulatory action of 5-LOX and prompt rapid and massive apoptosis (cancer cell destruction) (Moretti 2004; Ghosh 1998; Ghosh 2003; Anderson 1998). <strong></strong></p>
<h2>Omega-3 Fatty Acids: A First Line of Defense </h2>
<p>One reason that <strong>fish oil </strong>supplements have become so popular is that their beneficial <strong>EPA/DHA </strong>fatty acids can help reduce the production of <strong><em>arachidonic acid-derived </em></strong>tumor promoting byproducts in the body (Norris 2012; Barham 2000; Adan 1999; Schwartz 2000). As shown in Figure 2, if <strong><em>arachidonic acid </em></strong>levels are reduced, there would be a corresponding suppression of <strong>5-LOX </strong>and its metabolic byproducts <strong>5-HETE </strong>and <strong>leukotriene B4</strong>. </p>
<img alt=""list of foods that are high in arachidonic acid"" src=""/protocols/images/pc_prevention/dec2013_iodopcram_06.jpg"" border=""0""> <p>Once one understands the lethal 5-LOX cascades, it is easy to see why people who excessively consume foods rich in <strong>arachidonic acid</strong>, and those who fail to reduce the production of arachidonic acid metabolites (such as 5-HETE) by ensuring adequate intake of <strong><em>omega-3 </em></strong>fatty acids, are setting themselves up for prostate cancer and a host of inflammatory disorders (including atherosclerosis). </p>
<h2>Nutrients That Suppress 5-LOX </h2>
<p>Health-conscious people already take nutrients like <strong>curcumin </strong>and <strong>fish oil </strong>that help to lower 5-LOX activity in the body (Taccone-Gallucci 2006; Gupta SC 2013). Studies show that <strong>lycopene </strong>and <strong>saw palmetto </strong>extract also help to suppress 5-LOX (Hazai 2006; Bonvissuto 2011). The suppression of 5-LOX by these nutrients may partially account for their favorable effects on the prostate gland. </p>
<p>As humans age, however, chronic inflammatory processes can cause the over-expression of 5-LOX in the body (Qu 2000). For maturing males, the result of excess 5-LOX may be the epidemic of prostate cancer observed as men age (Roehrborn 2006). </p>
<p>Based on the cumulative knowledge that 5-LOX itself and its metabolic products can promote the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer cells, it would appear advantageous to take aggressive steps to suppress this lethal enzyme (Hazai 2006). </p>
<p>This can be done by avoiding foods that promote 5-LOX formation in the body and taking supplements that inhibit 5-LOX via differing pathways. </p>
<h2>Research Substantiating Boswellia </h2>
<p>Specific extracts from the <strong>boswellia </strong>plant selectively inhibit <strong><em>5-lipoxygenase </em></strong>(5-LOX), a potent inducer of inflammation and carcinogenic byproducts (Safayhi 1997; Safayhi 1995). </p>
<p>Boswellia extracts have been used for centuries, particularly in India as anti-inflammatory agents (Siddiqui MZ 2011). In several well-controlled human studies, <strong><em>boswellia </em></strong>has been shown to be effective in alleviating various chronic inflammatory disorders (Kimmatkar 2003; Ammon 2002; Gupta I 2001; Gerhardt 2001; Gupta 1998). </p>
<p>Scientists have discovered that the specific constituent in boswellia responsible for suppressing <strong>5-LOX </strong>is <strong>AKBA </strong>(<em>3-O-acetyl-11-keto-B-boswellic acid</em>) (Siddiqui MZ 2011). Boswellia-derived AKBA binds directly to <strong>5-LOX </strong>and inhibits its activity (Siddiqui MZ 2011). Other boswellic acids only partially and incompletely inhibit 5-LOX (Siddiqui MZ 2011; Sailer 1996). </p>
<p>Formulas containing high concentrations of <strong>AKBA </strong>from <strong>boswellia </strong>have been developed based on its ability to treat inflammatory disorders. Standardized <strong>boswellia </strong>extracts have long been included in prostate support nutrient formulas for the purpose of suppressing excess <strong>5-LOX</strong>. </p>

Not only do 5-LOX products directly stimulate cancer cells propagation, but the breakdown products that 5-LOX produces from arachidonic acid (such as leukotriene B4, 5-HETE, and hydroxylated fatty acids) cause tissue destruction, chronic inflammation, and increased resistance of tumor cells to apoptosis (programmed cell destruction) (Hassan 2006; Moretti 2004; Ghosh 1997; Jiang 2006; Yoshimura 2004; Zhang 2006; Soumaoro 2006; Hoque 2005; Zhi 2003; Rubinsztajn 2003; Subbarao 2004; Laufer 2003; Hennig 2002; Ding 1999). </p>
<p>It is important to understand that 5-LOX is not the only dangerous enzyme the body produces to break down arachidonic acid. As can be seen in Figure 2, both cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-1 and COX-2) also participate in the degradation of arachidonic acid. </p>
<p>COX-1 causes production of thromboxane A2, which can promote abnormal arterial blood clotting (thrombosis), resulting in heart attack and stroke (de Leval 2004; Cheng 2002; Catella-Lawson 2001; James 2001; Garcia Rodriguez 2001). <strong>Thromboxane A2 </strong>is also involved in tumor metastasis (Nie 2000; Dassesse 2006). COX-2 is directly involved in cancer cell propagation, while its breakdown product (prostaglandin E2) promotes chronic inflammation (Laufer 2003; Wang 2004; Onguru 2005; Wang 2006). Most health-conscious people already inhibit the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes by taking low-dose aspirin, curcumin, green tea, and various plant flavonoids such as pomegranate (Catella-Lawson 2001; Feldman 2001; Zhang 1999; Bengmark 2006; Park 2006; Hong 2004; Yoysungnoen 2006; Tunstall 2006; Lee 2005; Hong 2001; Ahmed 2002; Shukla 2008; Rosillo 2012; Hämäläinen 2011; O’Leary 2004). </p>
<p>A more integrative approach to this problem, however, would be to also reduce dietary levels of <strong>arachidonic acid</strong>, which is the precursor of 5-HETE and leukotriene B4 (Riehl 1992). </p></div></div>
<h2>Prostate-Protecting Properties of Boswellia </h2>
<p>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a proinflammatory cytokine that often increases in aging people (Gupta 2003). </p>
<p>From the standpoint of keeping prostate cancer cells in check, <strong>boswellia </strong>has been shown to prevent the TNF-alpha-induced expression of a proteindegrading enzyme called <strong><em>matrix metalloproteinase </em></strong>(MMP) (Roy 2005). Cancer cells use the MMP enzyme to tear apart natural barriers in the body that would normally encase them (Katiyar 2006). Prostate cancer cells are notorious for inducing the production of this enzyme (TNF-alpha) that causes containment structures within the prostate gland to vanish, thus enabling the cancerous prostate cells to break through healthy prostate tissue and eventually metastasize (Ridriguez-Berriguete 2013; Mizokami 2000). </p>
<p>Prostate cancer cells use adhesion molecules (known as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) to facilitate their spread throughout the body. Boswellia has been shown to prevent the up-regulation of these adhesion molecules, which are directly involved in inflammatory processes (Roy 2005). Chronic inflammation is tightly linked to the induction of aberrant angiogenesis used by cancer cells to facilitate the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) into tumors (Rajashekhar 2006). </p>
<p>The potent <strong>5-LOX-inhibiting </strong>properties of <strong>boswellia</strong>, and its ability to suppress other inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha, make it an important nutrient for those concerned with prostate cancer (Siddiqui MZ 2011; Roy 2005). </p>

Studies show that <strong>cauliflower</strong>, <strong>broccoli</strong>, <strong>flax lignans</strong>, and <strong>soy isoflavones </strong>protect against a host of diseases, including <strong>prostate cancer </strong>(Heald 2007; Hedelin 2006; Kumar 2004; Lee 2003; McCann 2005; Vij 2004; Sonoda 2004; Clark 2008; Abdull Razis 2013). </p>
<p>A <strong>2013 </strong>study reported that soy food consumption, more popular in Asian populations, is associated with a <strong>25 to 30% </strong>reduced risk of prostate cancer (Kimura 2012). There is a lot of confusion about soy in the alternative health community. Everyone agrees that limiting intake of <strong>soybean oil </strong>is important because it is loaded with <strong>omega-6 </strong>fats (SELF 2012). Other constituents found in soy, however, such as <strong>genistein </strong>and <strong>daidzein </strong>have demonstrated anti-prostate cancer mechanisms (Chen 2011; Lakshman 2008; Davis 1998; Davis 1999; Ozasa 2004; Park 2013; Dong 2013). </p>
<p>Polyphenols found in <strong>green tea </strong>decrease serum levels of PSA, hepatocyte growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in prostate cancer patients (Henning 2006; Bettuzzi 2006; Pandey 2009; McLarty 2009; Siddiqui 2006; Chuu 2009). </p>
<p>The FDA says, however, that there is insufficient evidence to claim that green tea consumption protects against prostate cancer (WebMD 2005). Life Extension issued a rebuttal to the FDA position on green tea and prostate cancer in the November 2005 edition of <strong><em>Life Extension </em></strong>magazine. </p></div></div>
<h2>Urgent Need to Alter Dietary Patterns </h2>
<p>Those consuming Western diets predispose themselves to cancer (Erdelyi 2009). It is encouraging that we know what food groups increase prostate cancer risk and what foods/nutrients reduce it.</p>
<p>All aging men should shift their diet towards foods that protect against prostate cancer. Those with rising or elevated PSA should be especially diligent in avoiding dietary factors that can fuel the growth of prostate tumors (WHF 2013).</p>
<p>The lethal impact of cancer-promoting foods may be mitigated by taking supplements such as <strong>green tea</strong>, <strong>curcumin</strong>, <strong>fish oil</strong>, <strong>pomegranate</strong>, and <strong>boswellia</strong>, along with regular inclusion of <strong>cruciferous vegetables </strong>and other healthy foods in one’s diet.</p></div>",https://www.lifeextension.com/Protocols/Cancer/Prostate-Cancer-Prevention/Page-04

<p>A remarkable new study has validated a method to slow <strong>prostate cancer</strong> progression that was long ago recommended to <strong><em>Life Extension</em></strong> customers. </p>
<p>What made this study even more noteworthy is where it was presented. </p>
<p>The annual gathering of the <strong>American Society of Clinical Oncology</strong> (ASCO) is considered the world’s most prestigious cancer forum. More than 25,000 oncology experts attend this meeting, and the media eagerly reports on meaningful advances in cancer prevention and treatment. </p>
<p>At the <strong>2013 ASCO</strong> meeting, findings from a study were released that underscored how <strong><em>effective</em></strong> certain <strong>natural compounds</strong> can be as a prostate cancer therapy. </p>
<p>In this placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of treatment-refractory prostate cancer patients, a four-nutrient supplement resulted in a <strong>63.8%</strong> median reduction in the increase of <strong>PSA</strong> levels (Thomas 2013). The PSA marker is used by oncologists to determine progression or regression of prostate cancer, and to evaluate whether treatments are working or failing.</p>
<p>In the study presented at <strong>ASCO</strong>, patients with a PSA relapse after radiotherapy or surgery for localized prostate cancer took two daily capsules containing <strong>pomegranate seed, broccoli, green tea, and turmeric</strong>. Over a six-month period, median PSA levels increased only <strong>14.7%</strong> in the supplement group—compared to <strong>78.5%</strong> in the placebo group (Thomas 2013)! PSA levels remained stable, or below, baseline values for a compelling <strong>46%</strong> of the supplement patients—but for only <strong>14%</strong> of the placebo patients. </p>
<p>Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in US men (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) (Siegel 2012), affecting one male in every six (PCF 2013b). Autopsy findings show a significant percentage of men have underlying prostate cancer without even knowing it (Harvei 1999; Billis 1986; Sakr 1995). </p>
<p>This section will present evidence about the prostate cancer preventing effects of a wide range of nutrients. What makes this topic so compelling are the recent findings presented at <strong>ASCO</strong> showing that <strong>pomegranate seed, green tea, broccoli</strong>, and <strong>turmeric</strong> (source of <strong>curcumin</strong>) were so effective in prostate cancer patients (Thomas 2013). The implication is that these nutrients may also afford considerable protection against prostate cancer progression. </p>
<p>A comprehensive defense against prostate cancer involves healthy diet, supplemental nutrients, hormone balance, and annual PSA screening. The foods and nutrients described herein have been documented in published studies to target prostate cancer and help prevent or attenuate its development. As a bonus, they also confer huge protection against other age-related disorders. </p>
<p>Since there are overlapping mechanisms of action amongst many of these foods/nutrients, it may not be necessary to take every one of them. Most impressive, however, is the voluminous amount of scientific evidence that substantiates the anti-cancer properties of these nutrients. Yet mainstream medicine remains largely in the dark. </p>
<h2>Nutrients for Prostate Cancer Prevention</h2>
<h3>Flaxseed </h3>
<p>Flaxseeds provide a rich supply of <strong><em>lignans </em></strong>and essential fatty acids that promote prostate health. The lignans in flaxseed are believed to offer protection against chronic disease and cancer, including hormone-dependent malignancies (Donaldson 2004; Stark 2002; Demark-Wahnefried 2004). </p>
<p>A large study demonstrated that men with higher <strong><em>enterolactone </em></strong>levels were up to <strong>72% </strong>less likely to have prostate cancer than those with the lowest levels (Hedelin 2006). Studies have confirmed that flaxseed supplementation lowers PSA levels, and significantly reduces the proliferation of normal prostate cells and prostate cancer cells (Demark-Wahnefried 2004; Demark-Wahnefried 2008). A pilot study on men who were scheduled to have a repeat prostate biopsy found that supplementation with flaxseeds, as part of a low-fat diet, lowered levels of PSA and prostate cell proliferation (Demark-Wahnefried 2004). </p>
<h3>Boron </h3>
<p>Research has shown that boron can reduce the risk of prostate cancer (Zhang 2001). In one study, men with the highest boron intake showed a <strong>54% lower </strong>risk of prostate cancer compared to those with the least intake (Cui 2004). </p>
<p>In a validated animal model of prostate cancer, researchers found that oral administration of various concentrations of a boron-containing solution led to <strong>25-38% decreases </strong>in tumor size, and <strong>86-89% reductions </strong>in PSA levels (Gallardo-Williams 2004). The suggestion that supplemental boron may help to shrink prostate tumors while also decreasing levels of PSA is exciting. That’s because PSA—in addition to being an important prostate cancer marker—may itself be a contributor to prostate cancer promotion (Webber 1995). </p>
<p>Boron compounds inhibit the activity of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (Gallardo-Williams 2004). Higher boron levels in the blood lower the risk of prostate cancer by reducing intracellular calcium signals and storage (Henderson 2009). At normal concentrations, boron operates selectively—inhibiting prostate cancer cell proliferation while allowing normal prostate cells to grow (Barranco 2004). </p>
<p>The typical daily intake range for boron is <strong>1-8 milligrams daily</strong>; however, individuals living in boron-rich environments may consume far greater than this amount (Meacham 2010). If lab studies can be replicated in human patients, higher daily dosages may become an effective and low-cost adjuvant therapy. <strong><em>Life Extension</em></strong>® customers already obtain boron (<strong>3-6 mg</strong>) in their supplements. </p>
<h3>Cruciferous Vegetables </h3>
<p>In recently released studies, three phytochemicals derived from <strong><em>cruciferous vegetables </em></strong>(such as <strong>broccoli) </strong>have shown promise in inhibiting prostate cancer in experimental models (Beaver 2012; Yu 2013). Because their chemical names are challenging—<strong>indole-3-carbinol</strong>, <strong>3,3’-diindolylmethane</strong>, and <strong>phenethyl isothiocyanate</strong>—they are better known as I3C, DIM, and PEITC, respectively. </p>
<p>I3C has several different actions that help prevent and inhibit prostate cancer. It helps activate detoxification pathways, prevents cancer cell growth, induces apoptosis, regulates gene expression, protects DNA from damage, and modulates a variety of cell signaling pathways (Yu 2013; Sarkar 2004; Fong 1990; Chinni 2001). </p>
<p>DIM has been shown to protect against prostate cancer by inhibiting the phosphorus-transferring enzyme <strong><em>Akt</em></strong>, inhibiting the master DNA-transcription regulator <strong><em>nuclear factor-kappaB </em></strong>(<strong><em>NF-kB</em></strong>)—and blocking the crosstalk between them (Li 2005). This is a novel mechanism through which DIM inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, but not in non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells (Li 2005). The ability of DIM to target aberrant epigenetic changes coupled with its ability to promote the detoxification of carcinogens, make it an effective chemopreventive agent as it is able to target multiple stages of prostate carcinogenesis (Meacham 2010). </p>
<p>In a study released in May 2013, PEITC was found to suppress a compound known as <strong><em>PCAF </em></strong>(<strong><em>P300/CBP-associated factor</em></strong>)—which in turn inhibits androgen receptor-regulated transcriptional activity in prostate cancer cells (Beaver 2012). Daily suggested dosages are <strong>14 milligrams </strong>for <strong>DIM</strong>, and <strong>80-160 milligrams </strong>for <strong>I3C</strong>. An I3C dosage of <strong>200-600 milligrams daily </strong>is suggested as an adjuvant for prostate cancer therapy. Dosages for PEITC are not well-established. </p>
<h3>Vitamin D </h3>
<p>As the <em>New England Journal of Medicine </em>clarified, “Cancer results from the accumulation of mutations in genes that regulate cellular proliferation” (Haber 2000). In other words, cancer is essentially caused by the genetic mutations that occur over the lifespan. The fascinating impact of vitamin D is that it protects against cancer by enabling us to regain control over the genes that regulate cell proliferation. Vitamin D affects at least 200 human genes (Holick 2007). These genes are responsible for regulating crucially important aspects of cells: their proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. </p>
<p>In recent years, a multitude of studies have shown cancer risk reductions of <strong>50% </strong>and greater based on higher vitamin D status (Garland 1989; Garland 1991; Garland 2007; Gorham 2005). People with higher vitamin D levels have lower risks of lethal prostate cancer, as well as reduced risks of other cancers (Holick 2007; Garland 1989; Yousef 2013; Skinner 2006; Polesel 2006; Shui 2012). Individual blood testing is needed to determine individual-appropriate dosages, which typically range from <strong>2,000 to 10,000 international units (IU) daily </strong>for prevention. Life Extension suggests an optimal vitamin D blood level of <strong>50-80 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL)</strong>. </p>
<h3>Soy Isoflavones </h3>
<p>Some studies show that the highest intake of soybased foods correlates with a <strong>42-75% lower </strong>risk of prostate cancer (Lee 2003; Sonoda 2004; Zhou 1999; Jacobsen 1998). Early animal studies found that this difference is most likely attributable to soy isoflavones inhibiting prostate tumor growth by acting directly against tumor cells and indirectly against tumor neovasculature (growth of new blood cells) (Zhou 1999). Human studies support this evidence. </p>
<p>Japanese scientists took blood samples from over 14,000 men during 1988-1990. Their analysis clearly established that elevated serum levels of all three isoflavones assessed—<strong><em>genistein</em></strong>, <strong><em>daidzein</em></strong>, and <strong><em>equol</em></strong>—imparted strong protective effects against prostate cancer (Ozasa 2004). Men with the highest circulating levels of genistein, daidzein, and equol reduced prostate cancer risk by <strong>62%</strong>, <strong>59%</strong>, and <strong>66%</strong>, respectively. Genistein and daidzein are found in soy, and equol is derived from daidzein by bacterial flora in the intestines (Ozasa 2004; USDA 2013; Wang 2005). Also, genistein was shown to have “potent anti-proliferative effects” against human prostate cells (Shen 2000) and inhibit metastasic potential of sex gland cancers such as prostate cancer (Schleicher 1999). Genistein also blocks an enzyme that destroys an anticancer vitamin D metabolite in cancer cells (Farhan 2002). A suggested dosage of soy isoflavones is <strong>135-270 milligrams daily </strong>with food. </p>
<h3>Green Tea Extract </h3>
<p>Laboratory research with cultures has long suggested that green tea catechins, including <strong><em>epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG)</em></strong>, may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. Evidence from human studies now demonstrates that green tea compounds can help prevent prostate cancer. A clinical trial demonstrated that green tea catechins were <strong>90% </strong>effective in preventing prostate cancer in men with pre-malignant lesions (Bettuzzi 2006). Researchers recruited 60 men, aged 45-75. Thirty participants received <strong>200 milligrams </strong>of green tea catechins (<strong>50% </strong>EGCG) <strong>three times daily</strong>, while the other 30 subjects received a placebo. Biopsies were conducted at six and 12 months. Remarkably, only <strong>one </strong>man in the treatment group was diagnosed with prostate cancer, compared to <strong>nine </strong>men in the control group who developed the disease. No significant side effects or adverse reactions were reported (Bettuzzi 2006). The lead researcher concluded that “<strong>90% </strong>of chemoprevention efficacy could be obtained by [green tea catechin] administration in men prone to developing prostate cancer” (Bettuzzi 2006). </p>
<p>Green tea polyphenols have also shown efficacy as an adjunctive therapy. Prostate cancer patients were given <strong>1,300 milligrams </strong>of green tea polyphenols, mostly EGCG, prior to the time of radical prostatectomy. They showed significant reductions in PSA and other tumor promoters such as <strong><em>vascular endothelial growth factor </em></strong>(McLarty 2009). Suggested dosages of EGCG are <strong>300-350 milligrams daily</strong>, and adjuvant cancer therapy dosages of EGCG range up to <strong>3,000 milligrams daily</strong>. The FDA, however, does not believe there is sufficient evidence to say that green tea reduces prostate cancer risk. A federal judge ruled against the FDA’s attempt to suppress claims that green tea may reduce prostate cancer risk (Faloon 2012). </p>
<h3>Omega-3 Fatty Acids </h3>
<p>In scientific studies, high blood levels of the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA (<strong><em>docosahexaenoic acid </em></strong>and <strong><em>eicosapentaenoic acid</em></strong>, respectively) have been demonstrated to correspond to a lower risk of developing prostate cancer (Norrish 1999). EPA has been shown to suppress the formation of the omega-6 fatty acid <strong><em>arachidonic acid </em></strong>(AA) by inhibiting the enzyme <strong><em>delta-5-desaturase</em></strong> (Dias 1995). EPA has also been found to contribute to the inhibition of <strong><em>uPA</em></strong>—a substance known as <strong><em>urokinase-type plasminogen activator </em></strong>believed to play a role in prostate cancer invasion and metastasis (du Toit 1996). </p>
<p>Although cold water fish such as tuna, sardines, herring, and salmon provide a rich omega-3 source, commercially available pharmaceutical-grade fish oils also deliver large amounts of EPA and DHA (Cleveland Clinic 2009). Suggested dosages are <strong>2-4 grams </strong>of fish oil concentrate supplying <strong>700-1,400 milligrams </strong>of EPA and <strong>500-1,000 milligrams </strong>of DHA, <strong>daily </strong>with food. For adjuvant cancer therapy, recommended dosages are <strong>4-8 grams </strong>of fish oil concentrate supplying up to <strong>2,800 milligrams </strong>of EPA and up to <strong>2,000 milligrams </strong>of DHA, <strong>daily </strong>with food. </p>
<h3>Curcumin </h3>
<p><strong>Curcumin </strong>strikes at multiple targets in prostate cancer (Shishodia, Chaturvedi 2007; Kunnumakkara 2008). It induces apoptosis, interferes with the spread of cancer cells, and regulates inflammatory responses through the master regulator <strong><em>nuclear factor-kappaB </em></strong>(<strong><em>NF-kB</em></strong>), a protein complex that controls the transcription of DNA (Plummer 1999; Teiten 2010; Khan 2010; Aggarwal 2007). Natural molecules that inhibit NF-kB can limit inflammatory changes (Gukovsky 2003). Prostate cancer is often dependent on sex hormones for its growth; curcumin reduces expression of sex-hormone receptors (<strong><em>androgen receptors </em></strong>and androgen receptor-related cofactors) in the prostate (Nakamura 2002; Choi 2010). This speeds androgen receptor breakdown and impairs cancer cells’ ability to respond to the effects of testosterone (Tsui 2008; Shi 2009). </p>
<p>Both <em>in vitro </em>and <em>in vivo </em>models demonstrate that curcumin inhibits prostate cancer promotion by blocking metastases of cancer cells in the prostate, and by regulating enzymes required for tissue invasiveness (Hong 2006; Herman 2009). In certain human prostate cancer cell lines, curcumin completely inhibited a type of phosphorustransferring enzyme known as <strong><em>Akt </em></strong>(also known as <strong><em>protein kinase B </em></strong>or <strong><em>PKB</em></strong>), suggesting that curcumin inhibits prostate cancer cell growth through this Akt-inhibiting mechanism (Chaudhary 2003). Curcumin has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in prostate cancer cells <em>in vivo</em> (Dorai 2001). A novel manufacturing technology has produced a patented curcumin formulation that absorbs up to <strong>seven times better </strong>than conventional curcumin (Antony 2008). If supplementing with this highly absorbed curcumin formulation (BCM-95®), suggested preventive dosage is <strong>400 milligrams daily </strong>with food. A suggested dosage of this formulation for adjuvant cancer therapy may be <strong>800-1,200 milligrams daily </strong>with food. </p>
<h3>Coenzyme Q10 </h3>
<p>Low blood levels of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10 or Q10) have been found in patients with a variety of cancer types (Rusciani 2006; Folkers 1997). Several published animal and human studies have demonstrated CoQ10’s remarkable effects against some cancers (Hodges 1999; Folkers 1993; Lockwood 1994; Perumal 2005; Folkers 1996; Portakal 2000; Ren 1997; Jolliet 1998), but research into its potentially protective effects against prostate cancer has been very limited. In 2005, after reviewing anecdotal reports appearing in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) reported that coenzyme Q10 has been anecdotally reported to lengthen the survival of patients with cancer of the prostate, as well as several other cancers (NCI 2013a). Despite these findings, the NCI pointed out that the absence of a control group in the human studies and other scientific weaknesses made it impossible to determine whether these beneficial results were directly related to CoQ10 therapy (NCI 2013a). </p>
<p>Later that same year, University of Miami researchers reported research showing that adding coenzyme Q10 <em>in vitro </em>to the most common prostate cancer cell line, PC3, inhibited cell growth by <strong>70% </strong>over 48 hours (UMMSM 2013). Evidence suggested that there had been a reduction in the expression of a key, anti-apoptotic gene protein, bcl-2, and through this mechanism, CoQ10 had restored the ability for apoptosis, allowing the cancer cells to kill themselves. “The most amazing part,” said UM research associate Niven Narain, “is that we’ve been able to restore a cancer cell’s ability to kill itself, while not impacting normal cells” (UMMSM 2013). The suggested preventive dosage of coenzyme Q10 is <strong>100 milligrams daily</strong>, and a suggested adjuvant dosage is <strong>200-500 milligrams daily</strong>, both taken after a meal. </p>
<h3>Gamma-Tocopherol Vitamin E </h3>
<p>A large study showed that the risk of prostate cancer declines with increasing concentrations of the <strong><em>alpha</em></strong>-tocopherol form of vitamin E, with the highest level corresponding to a <strong>35% lower </strong>risk; however, these protective effects were <strong><em>only </em></strong>observed when levels of <strong><em>gamma</em></strong>-tocopherol and levels of selenium were also high (Helzlsouer 2000). </p>
<p>Men with the highest <strong><em>gamma-</em></strong>tocopherol levels, those in the highest fifth of the distribution, were found to have a <strong>5-fold greater reduction </strong>in the risk of developing prostate cancer than men in the lowest fifth (Helzsouer 2000). Other research has shown that vitamin E reduces the growth rate of <em>existing </em>prostate cancers that are specifically exacerbated by a high-fat diet—reducing tumor growth rate within a high-fat diet to the same tumor growth rate as in a lower-fat (ideal) diet (Fleshner 1999). </p>
<p>While both alpha- and gamma-tocopherols are potent antioxidants<em>, </em><strong><em>gamma-tocopherol </em></strong>has a unique function. Because of its different chemical structure, gamma-tocopherol scavenges <strong><em>reactive nitrogen species</em></strong>, which can damage proteins, lipids, and DNA, and promote carcinogenesis (Prins 2008; Stone 1997; Christen 1997; Cooney 1993). The suggested dosage of <strong><em>gamma-tocopherol </em></strong>is <strong>200-250 milligrams daily</strong>, and the suggested adjuvant therapy dosage is <strong>400-1,000 milligrams daily</strong>, taken with food. </p>
<h3>Lycopene </h3>
<p>Lycopene is a carotenoid occurring abundantly in tomatoes. The relationship between its ingestion and prostate health is well established (Soares 2013; Rafi 2013; Giovannucci 1995; Wertz 2009; Lowe 2006; Trejo-Solís 2013; Obermuller-Jevic 2003; Kucuk 2001; Gann 1999). One laboratory experiment found that lycopene inhibited the growth of normal human prostate cells (Obermuller-Jevic 2003). Then, a clinical trial conducted on prostate cancer patients demonstrated that lycopene supplementation decreases the growth of prostate cancer (Kucuk 2001). In another compelling study, healthy men with the highest lycopene levels in their blood were shown to have a <strong>60% </strong>reduced risk of developing prostate cancer (Gann 1999). </p>
<p>Scientists found that lycopene works by reducing oxidative stress in prostate tissue; lowering inflammatory signaling; preventing DNA damage; modulating expression of endocrine growth factors; and may block cancer cells from growing out of control through enhanced communication between cancer cells at “gap junctions” (Wertz 2009; Trejo-Solís 2013). Lycopene also may slow the new blood vessel growth that prostate cancers need for development (Trejo-Solís 2013). Suggested dosages of <strong>15-30 milligrams daily </strong>are for prevention and up to <strong>45 milligrams daily </strong>with food for adjuvant support in existing prostate cancer. </p>
<h3>Selenium </h3>
<p>The body only needs small quantities of selenium (NIH 2013); however, blood levels of this mineral decrease with age, placing middle-aged to older men at high risk for inadequate selenium levels. Lower levels of selenium in the blood can correspond to an increased risk of an enlarged prostate, the condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (Eichholzer 2012). Low selenium levels were also found to parallel a <strong>four- to five-fold higher </strong>risk of prostate cancer (Brooks 2001). Remarkably, supplementation with selenium has been demonstrated to produce an up to <strong>63% reduced </strong>risk of prostate cancer (Duffield-Lillico 2002; Clark 1998). The mechanism behind this protection appears to be related to an antiproliferative effect, resulting from selenium’s upregulation of cell-cycle regulators (Venkateswaran 2002). </p>
<p>However, confusion arose in 2009 due to publication of a single negative study that substantially contributed to misinformation about the value of selenium against prostate cancer. Known as SELECT—for Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial—the study appeared to show that selenium, alone or in combination with vitamin E, had no detectable effect on preventing cancers (Klein 2011; Lippman 2009). Many experts have since condemned the trial’s methodology and conclusions (El-Bayoumy 2009)—and for a number of reasons. </p>
<p>One problem with the 2009 study was that it used only a single form of selenium (Klein 2011; Marshall 2011). This selenium compound is just one of several different forms in which selenium is available for nutritional supplementation. Data indicate that three forms of selenium—the two organic forms called <strong><em>L-selenomethionine </em></strong>and <strong><em>selenium-methyl L-selenocysteine</em></strong>, plus the inorganic form known as <strong><em>sodium selenite</em></strong>—have different degrees of action with regard to the effect on any incipient cancer cells that might be developing (El-Sayed 2006; Suzuki 2010; Lunoe 2011). Using one form weakened the potential protective benefits in the study. </p>
<p>More importantly, the highly flawed 2009 SELECT study used only one form of vitamin E, a synthetic form known as dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate. We have known for about 15 years that when alpha tocopherol is taken by itself, it displaces critically important gamma tocopherol—the form of vitamin E that is the most protective against prostate cancer (Christen 1997; Galli 2004; Jiang 2004; Gysin 2002; Helzlsouer 2000; Moyad 1999). By supplementing aging men with only one form of vitamin E, <strong><em>synthetic dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate</em></strong>, scientists in the 2009 SELECT study may have unwittingly increased subjects’ prostate cancer risk by depriving prostate cells of critical gamma tocopherol. Then, a 2011 meta-analysis of nine randomized, controlled clinical trials including 152,538 participants established that selenium supplementation cut risk for <strong>all </strong>cancers by <strong>24%</strong>. The cancer-preventive effect rose to <strong>36% </strong>in people with low baseline selenium levels (Lee EH 2011). </p>
<p>Based on research involving non-melanoma skin cancer patients—in which patients received either <strong>200 micrograms daily </strong>of selenium or a placebo— researchers concluded that selenium supplementation can slash the risk of dying from any type of cancer by <strong>50% </strong>(Clark 1996). Also, selenium’s efficacy could potentially be enhanced: one study observed the protective effects of high selenium levels against prostate cancer <strong>only </strong>when the concentrations of <strong><em>gamma-tocopherol</em></strong>, an isomer of vitamin E, were also high—suggesting that these two nutrients may work best together (Helzlsouer 2000). It is suggested that selenium be taken at dosages of <strong>200 micrograms daily </strong>with food. </p>
<h3>Zinc </h3>
<p>Evidence suggests that zinc may play an important and direct role in the prostate. For example, studies found that total zinc levels in the prostate are much higher than in other soft tissues in the body, and those with prostate cancer have been shown to have exceedingly low levels of zinc in the prostate (Gómez 2007; Zaichick 1997). Also, in normal prostate cells, zinc is highly concentrated intracellularly in the glandular epithelium—but adenocarcinoma cells taken from prostate tumors have lost their ability to amass zinc (Bataineh 2002; Huang 2006; Liang 1999). Supplementation with <strong>15 milligrams of zinc daily </strong>showed a trend toward modestly reduced risk of all invasive prostate cancers, but there was a significant <strong>66% </strong>reduction in risk of advanced prostate cancer (Gonzalez 2009). This indicates that zinc supplements may be beneficial in some subgroups of men for the most advanced forms of the disease. There was also a greater reduction in prostate cancer risk from zinc supplementation among men whose vegetable intake was high (Gonzalez 2009). Suggested preventive and adjuvant zinc dosages range between <strong>15 </strong>and <strong>50 milligrams a day</strong>. <strong><em></em></strong></p>
<h3>Milk Thistle </h3>
<p>Evidence demonstrates that the compounds in milk thistle—isosilybin, silibinin, and silymarin—offer protection against prostate cancer. Both silibinin and silymarin are strong antioxidants and inhibit human carcinoma cell growth and DNA synthesis (Zi 1999). <em>Silibinin </em>was found in animal research to exert cancer-fighting effects against an advanced form of human prostate tumor cells, resulting in a decrease in proliferation and an increase in programmed cancer-cell death (Singh 2004a; Singh 2003). <em>Silymarin </em>may block cancer cell development and growth; it was found to contain one or more constituents that induce cancer cell apoptosis and inhibit mitogenic (cell-division promoting) and survival signaling by prostate cancer cells, showing silymarin’s ability to tackle cancer from a number of different angles (Singh 2004b). Both silymarin and silibinin inhibit the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors from tumor cells, which are necessary for these cells to recruit the blood supply required for their continued growth (Singh 2004a). </p>
<p>In animal research, silibinin was found to exert cancer-fighting effects against an advanced form of human prostate tumor cells, resulting in decreased proliferation and increased cancer-cell apoptosis (Singh 2003). Silibinin has high bioavailability in the prostate after oral administration, and scientists concluded that it has strong potential to be developed as an intervention for hormone-refractory (castration-resistant) human prostate cancer (Zi 1999). Silibinin may also work synergistically with the chemotherapy drug <strong><em>doxorubicin </em></strong>to help kill cancer cells, making it a potential candidate for adjuvant therapy (Singh 2004a). </p>
<p>However, isosilybin B—a lesser known constituent that comprises no more than <strong>5% </strong>of silymarin and is absent from silibinin—appears to be more potent against prostate cancer cells than the other milk thistle substances (Davis-Searles 2005). Scientists reported that other compounds may require much higher concentrations to achieve the same anti-cancer effect elicited by a relatively small dose of isosilybin B (Davis-Searles 2005). It is important to note that some preparations sold as milk thistle extract, silymarin, or silibinin may contain little, or even no, isosilybin B. A typical suggested dosage of a quality standardized milk thistle extract is <strong>750 milligrams daily</strong>, taken with or without food. </p>
<h3>Gamma-Linolenic Acid (GLA)</h3>
<p>Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is an omega-6 essential fatty acid found mostly in plant-based oils. Not all omega-6 fatty acids behave the same: for example, the omega-6s called linoleic acid and arachidonic acid tend to be unhealthy because they promote inflammation; GLA, on the other hand, may serve to reduce inflammation (UMMC 2013a). Much of the GLA taken as a supplement is converted to a substance called <strong><em>DGLA </em></strong>(<strong><em>dihomogamma- linolenic acid</em></strong>), an omega-6 fatty acid with demonstrated anti-inflammatory effect (UMMC 2013a). Similar to the effect of the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), GLA has been found to inhibit the production of <strong><em>urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)</em></strong>, a substance believed to play a role in the invasiveness and metastasis of cancer cells (Dias 1995). </p>
<p>Scientists have also found that GLA metabolites suppress the activity of <strong><em>5alpha-reductase</em></strong>, an enzyme that converts testosterone to a more potent androgen (<strong><em>5alpha-dihydrotestosterone or DHT</em></strong>) and that is involved in the pathway of prostate cancer (Pham 2002). It is believed that GLA may also increase the effectiveness of some anticancer drug treatments (UMMC 2013a). The suggested GLA dosage for prevention is <strong>300 milligrams daily</strong>, or for adjuvant therapy, <strong>700-900 milligrams daily</strong>, both with food. </p>
<h3>Zeaxanthin </h3>
<p>Limited evidence suggests that higher zeaxanthin levels may be protective against prostate cancer (Lu 2001). In a 2001 study, a scientific team analyzed the plasma levels of various substances in a group of participants that included 65 patients with prostate cancer and 132 cancer-free controls. They found that, relative to those in the lowest quartile, those in the highest quartile of plasma zeaxanthin had a <strong>78% </strong>reduced risk of prostate cancer (Lu 2001). More study is needed to explore this potential benefit. Appropriate zeaxanthin supplementation amounts for prostate cancer defense have not been determined, but <strong>3.75 milligrams daily </strong>is a current suggested dosage. </p>
<h3>Pomegranate </h3>
<p>Use of pomegranate (<em>Punica granatum </em>L. var. <em>spinosa</em>) juice, peel, and oil has been shown to possess anticancer activities, including interference with tumor cell proliferation, cell cycle, invasiveness, and angiogenesis (Lansky 2007). Apoptosis was implicated as a mechanism for this interference with prostate cancer cell proliferation in a laboratory study in which researchers found that pomegranate extract increases expression of a protein that promotes cancer cell death, while decreasing expression of a protein that inhibits cancer cell death (Malik 2005). Later, in a 2012 study, scientists found that the in vitro cytotoxic activity of an extract of pomegranate against prostate cancer cells was dose-dependent—and they also suggested that this antiproliferative effect followed an apoptosis-dependent pathway (Sineh Sepehr 2012). </p>
<p>Further clarifying pomegranate’s effects against prostate cancer cells, scientists found evidence of induced beneficial gene expression—inhibiting proinflammatory, DNA-related protein <strong><em>nuclear factor kappa B </em></strong>(<strong><em>NF-kB</em></strong>) (Heber 2008) and downregulating production of cancer-stimulating androgen receptors in prostate cells (Hong 2008). The suggested dosage for prostate cancer prevention is <strong>80-120 milligrams daily </strong>(of punicalagins), and for adjuvant cancer therapy, <strong>280-375 milligrams daily </strong>(of punicalagins), with or without food. </p>
<h3>Saw Palmetto </h3>
<p>Saw palmetto (<em>Serenoa repens </em>or <em>Sabal serrulata</em>) is now one of the most widely used phytotherapies for BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the US (Gerber 2002; Wilt 2000), a condition characterized by an enlarged prostate gland. However, evidence has been emerging that saw palmetto also has biological activity in prostate cancer cells and may defend against prostate cancer (Yang Y 2007). For instance, a saw palmetto extract was shown to inhibit the activity of <strong><em>5alpha-reductase</em></strong> (Pais 2010), an enzyme that converts testosterone to the most potent androgen and that is involved in the pathway of prostate cancer. Saw palmetto also appears to have anti-inflammatory properties and—crucially—a tendency to promote apoptosis in prostate cancer cells (Sirab 2013; Hostanska 2007). </p>
<p>In one study, researchers described how they used saw palmetto extract to slow the growth of prostate cancer cells <em>in vitro</em>. This growth-inhibitory effect was <strong>more potent </strong>on prostate cancer cells than on other cancer cell lines on which they tested saw palmetto (Goldmann 2001). One new mechanism identified by this group of scientists was the saw palmetto-induced reduction in the expression of <strong><em>cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) </em></strong>in prostate cancer cells. Cancer cells often use COX-2 as biological fuel to hyperproliferate, and as the researchers presenting this report concluded, “We hypothesize that COX-2 inhibition induced by saw palmetto berry extract may provide an important basis for potential chemopreventative action” (Goldmann 2001). A typical suggested dose of saw palmetto is <strong>320 milligrams daily</strong>. </p>
<h3>Resveratrol </h3>
<p>By working through over a dozen anticancer mechanisms and selectively targeting cancer cells, resveratrol inhibits prostate cancer at multiple stages of development (Jang 1999). This potent compound, found in grapes and other plants, was first isolated in 1940 and is now viewed as a potential defense against this disease (Jang 1999; Jang 1997; Aggarwal 2004). In a study that examined the effect of various polyphenols on different types of prostate cancer cells, scientists concluded that resveratrol was the most potent against advanced prostate cancer cells (Kampa 2000). </p>
<p>Resveratrol has the ability to modulate the activity of estrogen and testosterone at both the cellular (receptor) and molecular (genetic) levels (Lu 1999; Seeni 2008; Mitchell 1999). In fact, after examining its effects on hormone-responsive genes in prostate cancer cells, researchers concluded that, “Resveratrol may be a useful chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic agent for prostate cancer” (Mitchell 1999). Also, resveratrol reverses increases in PSA in cancer cells (Mitchell 1999; Hsieh 2000). For example, in one study, four days of resveratrol treatment resulted in an <strong>80% reduction </strong>in PSA levels in prostate cancer cells (Hsieh 2000). Resveratrol also modulates growth factors, protects DNA, blocks cancer-causing chemicals and radiation, and fights free radicals and inflammation (MSKCC 2013a; Dubuisson 2002). The same anticancer gene activated by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) demonstrates enhanced expression by resveratrol (Baek 2002). </p>
<p>Using a DNA microarray—a scientific research tool that simultaneously examines how particular phytocompounds affect thousands of genes—scientists found that resveratrol exerts a striking effect on cancer-related genes. Among other things, resveratrol activates tumor suppressor genes, other genes that destroy cancer cells, and genes that control the cell cycle—while suppressing genes that allow cancer cells to communicate with one another (Narayanan 2003). This ability to get inside cancer cells and activate or deactivate genes is a powerful weapon against cancer growth—especially since resveratrol exerts its effects without toxicity (Lu 1999). Many resveratrol supplements on the market are diluted. For pure resveratrol, the suggested dosage is <strong>20-250 milligrams </strong>a day, taken with or without food. </p>
<h3>Supplemental Lignans </h3>
<p>Many different plant sources provide rich sources of lignans—and this may partially explain why men who eat healthier diets enjoy sharply reduced rates of prostate cancer (Miano 2003; Lamblin 2008). Lignan molecules are involved in plant defense mechanisms (Lamblin 2008). But experimental evidence suggests that dietary lignans also offer humans significant protection against tumors in a variety of organs—including tumors of the prostate (Yokota 2007; Bergman Jungeström 2007; Suzuki 2008; McCann 2008). In fact, researchers found that men with higher blood levels of lignans have the lowest incidence of prostate cancer (Hedelin 2006). Bacteria in the intestines convert dietary and supplemental lignans into mammalian lignan compounds called <strong><em>enterolactones</em></strong>, which enter the bloodstream (Heald 2006). </p>
<p>Findings from human, animal, and <em>in vitro </em>studies indicate that enterolactones protect against hormone-dependent cancers (Pietinen 2001; Piller 2006; Wang 2002). Tyrosine kinases are activated in metastatic prostate cancer cells, and enterolactones help to inhibit the tyrosine kinase enzyme (Chen LH 2009). Enterolactones have been shown to inhibit <strong><em>5alpha-reductase</em></strong>, an enzyme that converts testosterone to a more potent androgen (Evans 1995). Anti-angiogenesis effects and cancer-cell apoptosis were found to be enhanced by enterolactones in animal models of hormone-related cancers, including prostate cancer (Bergman Jungeström 2007; Chen 2007). Enterolactone also functions via several mechanisms to reduce estrogen input to cells and has been shown in a number of studies to be a factor in the development of benign prostate enlargement and prostate cancer (Wang 2002; Takase 2006; Bonkhoff 2005; Yang 2004; Steiner 2003). </p>
<p>A dosage of <strong>20-50 milligrams daily </strong>of lignans is suggested to defend against prostate cancer. For adjuvant prostate cancer support, <strong>75-125 milligrams daily </strong>is suggested. </p>
<h3>Vitamin K </h3>
<p>The anti-tumor potential of vitamin K has been a part of scientific research since 1947 (Lamson 2003). Researchers have observed tumor cell destruction in prostate cancer patients following supplementation with a combination of vitamin C and vitamin K3, the synthetic form of vitamin K (Lasalvia-Prisco 2003). (This same combination was later developed into the prostate cancer drug Apatone®, which has shown similar results [Tareen 2008]). </p>
<p>Subsequently, a study that followed 11,319 men for an average of 8.6 years found that those with the highest intake of <strong>vitamin K2 </strong>were <strong>63% less </strong>likely to develop advanced prostate cancer (Nimptsch 2008). The same research team found no effect on prostate cancer from vitamin K1 supplementation. Optimum prostate cancer prevention dosages for vitamin K2 are not known, but typically suggested <strong>daily </strong>dosages are <strong>1,000 micrograms </strong>for the menaquinone-4 form of K2 (MK-4) and <strong>200 micrograms </strong>for the menaquinone-7 (MK-7) form. </p>
<h3>Beta-Sitosterol </h3>
<p>A plant fat and phytosterol known as beta-sitosterol, used in several European prostate drugs, has been found to block the growth of prostate cancer cells. A study on an androgen-dependent line of prostate cancer cells showed that beta-sitosterol decreased cancer cell growth by <strong>24% </strong>and increased apoptosis <strong>four-fold </strong>(von Holtz 1998). These findings correlated with a <strong>50% </strong>increase in production of ceramide (von Holtz 1998), an important cell membrane component believed to induce apopotosis (Duan 2005). </p>
<p>In another study, an androgen-dependent line of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3 cell line) was implanted in mice, and scientists compared both the <em>in vivo </em>and <em>in vitro </em>effects of a <strong>2% </strong>mixture of beta-sitosterol with those of a <strong>2% </strong>mixture of cholesterol on these cells. Compared to controls, beta-sitosterol, as well as another phytosterol known as campesterol, inhibited growth of the prostate cancer cells by <strong>70% </strong>and <strong>14%</strong>, respectively (Awad 2001). By contrast, the cholesterol mixture increased cell growth by <strong>18%</strong>. Various other parameters were also measured. </p>
<p>For example, the phytosterol mixtures inhibited the invasion of the prostate cancer cells into <strong><em>Matrigel-coated membranes</em></strong>—a measure of cancer invasiveness— by <strong>78%</strong>, compared to controls, while the cholesterol mixture increased invasiveness by <strong>43% </strong>(Awad 2001). Also, migration of the prostate tumor cells through <strong><em>8-micron pore membranes</em></strong>—a measure of tumor motility—was reduced by <strong>60-93% </strong>when they were in the phytosterol mixtures, but it was increased by <strong>67% </strong>when in the cholesterol (Awad 2001). In a measure of adhesiveness and ability to form tumor clumps, phytosterol supplementation reduced the binding of these cancer cells to laminin by <strong>15-38% </strong>and to fibronectin by <strong>23%</strong>, while cholesterol increased cell-binding to type IV collagen by <strong>36% </strong>(Awad 2001). The research team concluded that—indirectly <em>in vivo </em>as a dietary supplement, and directly <em>in vitro </em>in tissue culture media—phytosterols inhibited the growth and metastasis of these (PC-3) prostate cancer cells. Beta-sitosterol, however, was determined to be much more effective than campesterol in offering this protection in most parameters assessed (Awad 2001). </p>
<p>In later research on the mechanism involved, scientists determined that phytosterols such as beta-sitosterol may induce the inhibition of tumor growth by stimulating apoptosis and arresting cells at different locations in the cell cycle, and that this may involve alterations in reactive oxygen species and production of prostaglandin (Awad 2005). A suggested phytosterol dosage is <strong>169 milligrams twice daily </strong>with or without food. </p>
<h3>Apigenin </h3>
<p>In studies on human cancer cells, scientists observed that the vegetable extract apigenin inhibits angiogenesis and cell proliferation (Fang 2005; Fang 2007; Luo 2008). These effects were confirmed in an animal experiment in which scientists transplanted an androgen dependent line of human prostate cancer cells into mice bred to serve as a model for tumor growth conditions (Shukla 2005). A liquid suspension containing either apigenin or placebo was given to the mice daily, via a gastric tube, for eight or ten weeks. Administering apigenin to mice—beginning either two weeks before, or two weeks after, inoculation with the cells—inhibited the volume of prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner by as much as <strong>59% </strong>and <strong>53%</strong>, respectively (Shukla 2005). Induction of apoptosis in the tumor xenografts was observed. In the same study, exposure of prostate cancer cells to apigenin in a culture for as little as 24 hours appeared to inhibit cell cycle progression by nearly <strong>69% </strong>(Shukla 2005). </p>
<p>Scientists believe these effects may result from apigenin’s modulation of the IGF (<strong><em>insulin-like growth factors</em></strong>) axis, which plays signaling roles in cell proliferation and cell death (Shukla 2010). Later research demonstrated that apigenin also inhibits motility and invasiveness of prostate carcinoma cells (Franzen 2009). The importance of supplementation for prostate protection is reflected in the fact that Americans typically consume only <strong>13 milligrams </strong>of flavonoids (including flavones like apigenin) daily (Shukla 2010); however, a suggested apigenin preventive dosage is <strong>25-50 milligrams daily</strong>, and adjuvant dosage for prostate cancer patients may exceed <strong>100 milligrams </strong>daily. </p>
<h3>Ginger (<em>Zingiber officinale</em>) </h3>
<p>A study reported in 2013 demonstrated that ginger phytochemicals work synergistically to inhibit the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3 cell line) (Brahmbhatt 2013). In past research, ginger showed anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiproliferative activities, suggesting a promising role as a chemopreventive agent (Shukla 2007; Karna 2012). Then, a 2012 study became the first report to clearly demonstrate the anticancer activity of orally taken, whole ginger extract for the therapeutic management of prostate cancer (Karna 2012). This breakthrough research found that ginger resulted in growth inhibition, cell-cycle arrest, and induced caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis in prostate cancer cells (Karna 2012). In vivo studies by this team showed that—without any detectable toxicity—ginger significantly inhibited tumor growth in xenografts of a line of prostate cancer cells (PC3) subcutaneously implanted in nude mice (Karna 2012). </p>
<p>Specifically, the scientific team orally fed a solution containing ginger extract to the tumor-implanted mice for eight weeks. Daily measurements of tumor volume were performed. Tumors in control mice that received a placebo solution showed unrestricted growth. But tumors in mice that received the ginger extract solution showed a time-dependent inhibition of growth over the eight-week period. Remarkably, the tumor burden in the ginger group was <strong>reduced </strong>by about <strong>56% </strong>after just eight weeks of feeding (Karna 2012). Tumor tissue from ginger extract-treated mice showed a reduced proliferation index and “widespread apoptosis” compared with controls (Karna 2012). Ginger treatment was well tolerated, and the test mice maintained normal weight gain and showed no signs of discomfort during the treatment regimen. Most importantly, orally taken ginger extract did not exert any detectable toxicity in normal, rapidly dividing tissues such as the gut and bone marrow. </p>
<p>Although further research is urgently needed, this study suggests that ginger extract has anticancer effects against human prostate cancer cells. No dosage for this purpose has been determined, but the study team performed allometric scaling calculations to extrapolate the mice dosage to humans. The human equivalent dose of ginger extract was found to be approximately <strong>567 milligrams daily </strong>for a 154-pound (<strong>70 kilogram</strong>) human adult (Karna 2012; Reagan-Shaw 2008). This may be viewed as an adjuvant therapy dosage, and an appropriate preventive dosage would be significantly less. </p>
<h3>Inositol Hexaphosphate (IP6) </h3>
<p>Inositol hexaphosphate, or IP6, is a phytochemical found in cereals, soy, legumes, and other fiber-rich foods (ACS 2013b). Building on earlier <em>in vitro </em>research showing that IP6 strongly inhibits growth and induces differentiation of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3 cells) (Shamsuddin 1995), scientists designed an animal study. They injected mice with a line of human prostate cancer cells (DU145 cells) and then gave them either normal drinking water or water that included <strong>1% </strong>or <strong>2% </strong>IP6 for 12 weeks. The hormone-refractory (castration-resistant) prostate cancer growth was <strong>reduced 47% </strong>in the <strong>1% </strong>IP6-solution mice and <strong>reduced 66% </strong>in the <strong>2% </strong>IP6-solution mice, compared to littermates without the IP6-enriched drinking water diet (Singh 2004c). </p>
<p>Then, in 2013, scientists designed an IP6 experiment on TRAMP mice, which are genetically modified to develop metastatic prostate cancer (Raina 2013). For 24 weeks, mice with prostate cancer were given drinking water that was <strong>0%</strong>,<strong> 1%</strong>, <strong>2%</strong>, or <strong>4% </strong>IP6. The study team periodically conducted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests on each mouse prostate to assess prostate volume and tumor vascularity. The animals that received higher concentrations of IP6 showed a “<strong>profound</strong>” <strong>reduction </strong>in prostate tumor size, due in part to the compound’s antiangiogenic effect (the ability of the compound to reduce new blood vessel formation) (Raina 2013). The researchers discovered a decrease in a glucose transporter protein, known as GLUT-4, in the prostates of IP6-treated mice, and observed that IP6 decreased glucose metabolism and membrane phospholipid synthesis—meaning there was substantial energy deprivation with the tumor itself. This demonstrates “a practical and translational potential of IP6 treatment in suppressing growth and progression of prostate cancer in humans” (Raina 2013). </p>
<h3>N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) </h3>
<p>N-acetylcysteine, or NAC, is a metabolite of the amino acid cysteine, which is found in many protein-containing foods (WebMD 2013). It is used both as a prescription drug and a dietary supplement. As a drug, it is given orally to treat acetaminophen overdose; as a supplement, it is used as an antioxidant and to promote metabolism of glutathione, a potent endogenous antioxidant (MSKCC 2013b). Research now indicates it can inhibit growth and block the metastasis of prostate cancer. In an <em>in vitro </em>study, researchers found that NAC significantly inhibited androgen-independent prostate carcinoma cells (PC-3 cells) in a dose- and time-dependent manner—suggesting a potent antiproliferative effect and the promise that NAC may be of benefit in the management of prostate cancer (Lee YJ 2011). </p>
<p>Scientists then conducted another lab study to assess the effect of NAC on the metastasis of human prostate cancer cells. They found that NAC inhibited the growth, migration, and invasion of two cell lines (DU145 and PC3 cells) (Supabphol 2012). Also, NAC significantly reduced the ability of the prostate cancer cells to attach themselves (to collagen IV-coated surfaces) (Supabphol 2012). Inhibition occurred in both cell lines. The team concluded that NAC has high potential to attenuate migration of human prostate cancer cells and to suppress the growth of primary and secondary tumors—and they suggested NAC may represent an affordable and low-toxicity, adjuvant-therapy option for prostate cancer (Supabphol 2012). Dosages of <strong>600 milligrams daily </strong>are typical, but higher dosages may be needed for adjuvant cancer therapy. </p>
<h3>Quercetin </h3>
<p>Quercetin is a flavonoid found in a broad range of fruits and vegetables (Nair 2004). Lab research has suggested that quercetin inhibits prostate cancer development. Scientists found that quercetin produces a <strong>69% reduction </strong>in the growth of highly aggressive prostate cancer cells, a greater than <strong>50% upregulation </strong>of tumor-suppressor genes, and a <strong>61-100% downregulation </strong>of cancer-promoting oncogenes (Nair 2004). A study suggested that quercetin works partially by blocking the androgen receptors used to sustain growth by prostate cancer cells—potentially preventing these cells from forming tumors (Yuan 2010). Another quercetin anticancer mechanism was revealed in a study on human prostate cancer (PC-3) cells. Quercetin induced the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway and endoplasmic reticulum stress, triggering DNA damage and apoptotic death in these cells (Liu 2012). Other research confirmed that quercetin inhibits the migration and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells (Senthilkumar 2011). A suggested preventive dosage is <strong>500 milligrams daily </strong>and an adjuvant prostate cancer dosage is <strong>1,000-3,000 milligrams daily</strong>. (The lower dosage of <strong>500 milligrams daily </strong>is currently being tested in a double-blind, human clinical trial on the effect of quercetin on the rate of increase in PSA and on the incidence of prostate cancer, but these results are not expected to be available until 2014 [Bischoff 2012]). </p>
<h3>Reishi </h3>
<p>Constituents called triterpenes in the fungus <em>Ganoderma lucidum</em>, better known as reishi mushroom, provide important anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects that play a role in cancer (Dudhgaonkar 2009). These mechanisms, combined with the polysaccharides and other components in reishi, can inhibit cancer—including prostate cancer cells (Zaidman 2007; Zaidman 2008). While reishi has been heavily studied for its ability to enhance immunity, some scientists adopted a novel approach to researching potential effects of fungi against prostate cancer. They evaluated the ability of various fungus extracts to act from within the cell to interfere with the androgen receptor and thus, inhibit prostate cancer growth (Zaidman 2007; Zaidman 2008). </p>
<p>These researchers investigated over 200 fungus extracts for their anti-androgenic activity—and of these, <em>G. lucidum </em>(reishi) was one of two mushrooms selected for further investigation (Zaidman 2008). This extract also blocked cell proliferation and decreased cancer cell viability (Zaidman 2008). Reishi inhibited androgen-sensitive, human prostate adenocarcinoma cells (LNCaP cells) (Zaidman 2007). The published report concluded that, “<em>G. lucidum </em>extracts have profound activity against LNCaP cells that merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of prostate cancer” (Zaidman 2007). A suggested preventive dosage of reishi extract is <strong>980 milligrams daily </strong>(standardized to contain <strong>13.5% </strong>polysaccharides and <strong>6% </strong>triterpenes). For adjuvant support in prostate cancer, dosages range from <strong>980 up to 3,000 milligrams daily </strong>(standardized to contain <strong>13.5% </strong>polysaccharides and <strong>6% </strong>triterpenes). <strong></strong></p>
<h3><em>Boswellia serrata</em> extract</h3>
<p>Aging humans are at increased risk of health complications and mortality via the upregulation of a proinflammatory enzyme called <strong><em>5-lipoxygenase</em></strong>, or <strong><em>5-LOX</em></strong> (Chu 2009). The 5-LOX enzyme generates a cascade of dangerous inflammatory effects throughout the body—which results in increased vulnerability of the organs to disease and functional deficits, particularly as the aging process progresses (Chu 2009; Chinnici 2007). This enzyme stimulates the manufacture of pro-inflammatory molecules called <strong><em>leukotrienes</em></strong>, which are linked in abundant research to numerous age-related diseases—including cancer (Chu 2009; Sampson 2009; Goodman 2011; Angelucci 2008; Faronato 2007). Compounds in the flowering plant genus <em>Boswellia</em>—<strong><em>beta-boswellic acid</em></strong>, <strong><em>keto-beta-boswellic acid</em></strong>, and <strong><em>acetyl-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA)</em></strong>—were shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells (Liu 2002). But a purified extract of <em>Boswellia </em>has been specifically shown to selectively inhibit the 5-LOX enzyme (Safayhi 1997; Safayhi 1995; Lalithakumari 2006). </p>
<p>This purified extract—5-Loxin®—is standardized for AKBA content and protects against inflammatory diseases, including prostate cancer, through several mechanisms. For example, virtually all human cancer cell lines, including prostate cancer cells, induce production of a protein-degrading enzyme called <strong><em>matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)</em></strong>, which cancer cells employ to tear apart containment structures within the prostate gland that would normally encase them. This allows the prostate cancer cells to break through healthy prostate tissue and metastasize (Katiyar 2006). However, 5-Loxin® has been shown to prevent expression of MMP—inhibiting the spread of prostate cancer cells. </p>
<p>Prostate cancer cells also use adhesion molecules called <strong><em>VCAM-1 </em></strong>and <strong><em>ICAM-1</em></strong>—which are directly involved in inflammatory processes—to facilitate their spread throughout the body. 5-Loxin® was shown to prevent the upregulation of these adhesion molecules (Lalithakumari 2006). Also, the process of angiogenesis that feeds blood to developing cancer tumors is tightly linked to chronic inflammation (Rajashekhar 2006). A typical suggested dosage of 5-Loxin® is <strong>70-100 milligrams daily </strong>with or without food. Individuals with prostate cancer may consider dosages of <strong>170 </strong>to <strong>270 milligrams </strong>a day of 5-Loxin®. </p>
<h3>Watercress Extract </h3>
<p>Epidemiological evidence suggests that increased intake of cruciferous vegetables reduces the risk of prostate cancer, prompting scientists to identify the specific compounds responsible for this cancer-preventive effect. They found that a metabolite of <strong><em>phenethyl isothiocyanate </em></strong>(PEITC) that is abundant in watercress inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and their ability to form tumors (Chiao 2004). And watercress is the richest source of a glucosinolate known as <strong><em>nasturtiin</em></strong>—which is transformed into PEITC in the digestive tract (Palaniswamy 2003). </p>
<p>A delicate balance of estrogens is crucially important for men’s health as well as women’s. In a study that examined the ratio of estrogen metabolites relative to prostate cancer risk, elevated levels of the more active metabolite, 16-hydroxyestrone, were linked with an increased risk of prostate cancer (Muti 2002). </p>
<p>Cruciferous vegetables such as watercress are very rich in the compounds <strong><em>indole-3-carbinol </em></strong>(I3C) and <strong><em>3,3’-diindolylmethane </em></strong>(DIM), which beneficially modulate estrogen metabolism—correlating with a reduced risk of prostate cancer (Li 2005; Kristal 2002; Heath 2010). </p>
<p>The constituents in watercress were also found to induce phase I and phase II liver enzymes, providing detoxification support that could explain their ability to inhibit the cancer-provoking effects of a variety of chemical compounds (Lhoste 2004). The suggested dosage for watercress extract is <strong>50-100 milligrams daily</strong>, taken with or without food. </p>
<h3>Grapeseed </h3>
<p>Grapeseed extract contains a mixture of phenolic compounds including flavonoids, anthocyanins, and stilbene compounds such as resveratrol (Nassiri-Asl 2009). Emerging research suggests it may be a chemopreventive agent (Kaur 2009; Brasky 2011). Several investigators reported a reduction or delay of prostate tumor incidence when male animals were fed grapeseed extract (Raina 2007). Also, grapeseed proanthocyanidins inhibited human prostate carcinoma cells in lab culture (Vayalil 2004). However, it wasn’t until 2011 that scientists investigated the association of long-term grapeseed supplementation with prostate cancer risk in human males (Brasky 2011). </p>
<p>In a 2011 prostate cancer study of more than 35,000 men aged 50 to 76, researchers found that, compared to non-users, men who supplemented with any amount of grapeseed extract reduced their risk of prostate cancer by <strong>41% </strong>(Brasky 2011). However, men with a high 10-year average use of grapeseed supplements experienced a remarkable <strong>62% </strong>reduction in prostate cancer risk (Brasky 2011). </p>
<p>Studies on consumption of wine—which contains grapeseed phenols—found no association with prostate cancer risk (Albertsen 2002; Chao 2010; Sutcliffe 2007). Also, two large studies on food-based intake of flavonoids, flavonols, and flavones found no association with prostate cancer risk (Hirvonen 2001; Mursu 2008). Scientists reporting the compelling beneficial results of grapeseed extract supplementation on prostate cancer risk in the 2011 study (above) suggested that, “One explanation for the discrepancy…is that users of grapeseed supplements may be exposed to higher doses of these phenolic compounds than they would from their regular diet” (Brasky 2011). The suggested preventive dosage is <strong>50-100 milligrams daily</strong>, and the suggested adjuvant therapeutic dosage is <strong>300 milligrams daily</strong>. </p>
<h3>Glycyrrhizin </h3>
<p>Glycyrrhizin, a triterpene compound isolated from the roots of licorice has been found to exhibit potent <em>in vitro </em>cytotoxic activity against both hormone-dependent (LNCaP), and hormone-independent (DU- 145), lines of human prostate cancer (Thirugnanam 2008). In one study, glycyrrhizin inhibited cell proliferation in these cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Thirugnanam 2008). The decreased viability was found to be due to apoptosis. Glycyrrhizin also caused DNA damage in these cell lines in a time-dependent manner (Thirugnanam 2008). This suggests that this licorice compound has therapeutic potential against prostate cancer, although a recommended dosage has not been determined. </p>
<h3>Modified Citrus Pectin </h3>
<p>Pectin is a highly complex, branched polysaccharide fiber that is present in most plants and is particularly abundant in citrus fruits like oranges, lemons, and grapefruit (Niture 2013). Citrus pectin, in its original form, has a limited solubility in water and therefore limited bioavailability to humans (Niture 2013). But in its modified form after hydrolysis, a special formulation of modified citrus pectin becomes a unique water-soluble fiber (Niture 2013; Glinsky 2009). This modified form has been shown to bind to the important <strong><em>galectin </em></strong>molecules on the surface of cells (Glinsky 2009). Scientists believe that this ability of the modified citrus pectin to adhere to molecules—specifically to the <strong><em>galectin-3 </em></strong><strong><em>molecule</em></strong>—is responsible for its demonstrated ability to inhibit cancer cells (Inohara 1994; Nangia-Makker 2002; Guess 2003). This preventive effect was shown in animal research. For example, oral administration of modified citrus pectin inhibited the <strong><em>spontaneous </em></strong>extraprostatic <strong><em>colonization </em></strong>of injected cells from a prostate cancer cell line and in a dose-dependent fashion (Pienta 1995). </p>
<p>Cancer cells must communicate with one another to invade, colonize, and proliferate in healthy tissue; but this proprietary citrus pectin appears to disrupt this inter-cellular communication, slowing metastasis. The American Cancer Society suggests that modified citrus pectin may “be useful for preventing or slowing the growth of metastatic tumors in very early stages of development” (ACS 2008). For instance, <strong>70% </strong>of prostate cancer patients treated orally for 12 months with a modified citrus pectin preparation experienced a slow-down in the rise of <strong><em>prostate-specific antigen</em></strong>, or <strong><em>PSA</em></strong>, concentrations in the blood—without side effects (Guess 2003). A suggested dosage is <strong>5-15 grams daily</strong>, taken without food. </p>
<h3>Four-Nutrient Supplement – Pomegranate, Broccoli, Green Tea, and Turmeric </h3>
<p>As discussed, inhibiting effects against prostate cancer have been reported in published studies for a number of individual nutrients, including pomegranate extract (Malik 2005; Sineh 2012), broccoli compounds (I3C, DIM, and PEITC) (Meacham 2010; Beaver 2012; Yu 2013), green tea extract (Bettuzzi 2006; McLarty 2009), and curcumin (a key compound in turmeric) (Shishodia, Chaturvedi 2007; Hong 2006; Herman 2009). A recent, double-blind study documented the potency—and possible synergism—of a supplement that combines powders from all four of these food sources (Thomas 2013). </p>
<p>Patients with a PSA relapse after radiotherapy or surgery for localized prostate cancer were randomized to receive capsules of either placebo or the four-nutrient supplement, three times daily. After six months, the median increase in PSA levels in the supplemented group was only <strong>14.7%</strong>, while the median PSA increase in the placebo group was <strong>78.5% </strong>(Thomas 2013). A striking <strong>46% </strong>of the supplemented subjects showed PSA levels that were at or below baseline values, compared to only <strong>14% </strong>of the placebo subjects. Among supplemented patients, <strong>92.6% </strong>were able to continue on active surveillance, compared to just <strong>74% </strong>of the placebo patients (Thomas 2013). There were no statistically significant side effects (Thomas 2013). This identical formula is now commercially available, though it’s likely that many Life Extension® customers have already been taking comparable potencies in supplements that contain these specific nutrients. </p>

    Consumption of 20–30 g of fiber daily has been recommended by some diverticular disease researchers. Supplemental fiber in the form of agents like psyllium
    seed husk and ground flaxseed can help increase total daily fiber intake. Patients with diverticular disease who begin fiber supplementation or a program
    of increased dietary fiber should do so gradually, over a period of weeks, and simultaneously increase their fluid intake. This is because increasing one’s
    fiber intake too rapidly can cause symptoms of digestive upset such as gas and bloating. Also, for those recovering from a bout of acute diverticulitis, a
    low-fiber diet may be advised; people in this situation should talk with their healthcare provider before increasing fiber in their diet, including
    supplemental fiber (Saul 2015; Thaha 2015; Slavin 2013; Wick 2012).

<h2>
    Probiotics 
</h2>
<p>
    Probiotics are living microorganisms (LPI 2015; Haukioja 2010) that exert health benefits through immune modulation and anti-inflammatory effects, as well
    as their ability to inhibit intestinal colonization by harmful microorganisms (Tursi 2014).
</p>
<p>
    Diverticular disease is increasingly being recognized as an inflammatory disorder that may be related to a disturbed intestinal microbial ecosystem,
    sometimes called “dysbiosis.” By helping restore the balance of intestinal flora and reduce inflammation in the colon, probiotic supplementation may be of
    benefit in both acute and chronic diverticular problems (Boynton 2013; Mengheri 2008).
</p>
<p>
    Most probiotic supplements are made with strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria (Guarner 2012; CDRF 2015).
</p>
<p>
    In an open-label trial, a combination of <em>Lactobacillus acidophilus</em> 145 and <em>Bifidobacterium species</em> 420 was found to be effective for
    preventing disease recurrence in people with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) (Lamiki 2010). Several controlled trials have
    demonstrated a positive effect of probiotics in SUDD. In one trial, a high-fiber diet plus the probiotic <em>Lactobacillus paracasei</em> B21060 was
    compared to a high-fiber diet alone. After three and six months of treatment, abdominal pain was significantly improved in both groups, while bloating
    improved significantly only in the probiotic group (Lahner 2012). Another study compared a high-fiber diet alone to a high-fiber diet plus either low-dose
    or high-dose <em>Lactobacillus paracasei </em>F19. Both probiotic-treated groups had significant reductions in bloating; no subjects in the probiotic group
    reported persistent pain lasting longer than 24 hours (Annibale 2011).
</p>
<p>
    Results from two additional open-label studies suggest a probiotic containing <em>Lactobacillus casei</em> DG may help reduce symptoms and prevent
    recurrence of acute diverticulitis in people with SUDD. The effect of this probiotic was comparable to mesalamine in both studies, but the combination of
    mesalamine plus <em>Lactobacillus casei</em> DG appeared to perform slightly better than either alone (Tursi 2006; Tursi 2008). A randomized controlled
    trial in 210 subjects with SUDD appeared to confirm these findings: the trial compared <em>Lactobacillus casei</em> DG and mesalamine, together and
    separately, with placebo. Cyclic schedules of 10 days per month were used for all interventions. After one year, both the probiotic and mesalamine were
    found to be more effective than placebo for maintaining remission; additionally, the combination of probiotic plus mesalamine appeared to work better than
    either alone (Tursi 2013).
</p>
<h2>
    Butyrate
</h2>
<p>
    Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid produced in humans by intestinal bacteria that digest and metabolize fiber. Butyrate is critical to colonic mucosal
    health; is the preferred fuel of the cells that line the interior of the colon; helps maintain the intestinal barrier; has anti-inflammatory and
    anti-cancer effects; and helps regulate colonic motility (Slavin 2013; Leonel 2012; Sossai 2012).
</p>
<p>
    In a randomized clinical trial of sodium butyrate in 52 people with diverticular disease, subjects received either a twice daily dose of 150 mg of oral
    microencapsulated sodium butyrate or placebo. After one year, just 7% of those in the butyrate group experienced diverticulitis symptoms compared with 31%
    in the placebo group (Krokowicz, Stojcev 2014).
</p>
<p>
    A preclinical trial studied the effect of calcium butyrate introduced directly into the colon of rodents in an induced model of inflammatory bowel disease
    (IBD). Calcium butyrate completely prevented the weight loss typical of rats with induced colitis and significantly reduced the tissue damage and fluid
    accumulation of colitis, by 48% and 22.7%, respectively. In a laboratory component of this study, calcium butyrate also exhibited antitumor effects
    (Celasco 2014).
</p>
<p>
    Clinical studies have shown that butyrate, in the form of sodium butyrate<em>,</em> reduced the frequency of symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and eased
    traveler’s diarrhea (Banasiewicz 2013; Krokowicz, Kaczmarek 2014). It has been proposed that supplemental butyrate may be beneficial in IBD as well as
    colorectal cancer and certain metabolic diseases (Sossai 2012).
</p>
<h2>
    Anti-inflammatory Agents
</h2>

<p>
    Natural anti-inflammatory compounds may counteract some of the inflammatory processes that contribute to diverticular disease. These include the omega-3
fatty acids from fish, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); curcumin from the turmeric plant, <em>Curcuma longa</em>; and    <em>Boswellia serrata</em> extract. Clinical trials to evaluate the specific effect of these natural anti-inflammatory agents in diverticular disease are
    still needed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Omega-3 fatty acids. </strong>
    EPA and DHA have been extensively studied for their general anti-inflammatory activity, and many studies have demonstrated that omega-3 fats are beneficial
    in IBD (Farrukh 2014). Low levels of omega-3 fats have been found in patients with IBD, and almost all trials using fish oil supplements have demonstrated
    a beneficial effect, with the best results in ulcerative colitis (Farrukh 2014; Siguel 1996).
</p>
<p>
    Emerging evidence suggests an overlap between the inflammation that characterizes chronic diverticular disease and that of IBD (Peppercorn 2004; Strate,
    Modi 2012). For this reason, treatments that are of benefit in IBD are worthy of consideration in diverticular disease. Several university-associated
    medical centers recommend supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, including from fish oil, in diverticular disease, in doses ranging from 1–5.5 g per day (UMMC
    2013; PSH 2015; LHMC 2015).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Curcumin. </strong>
    Curcumin is an anti-inflammatory compound from the culinary and medicinal herb turmeric (<em>Curcuma longa</em>) (Iqbal 2003). Preclinical studies suggest
    curcumin may be of benefit in inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis. Studies in animal models of IBD have shown that curcumin can inhibit
    tumor necrosis factor-alpha, one of the inflammatory chemical messengers associated with diverticular disease and acute diverticulitis (Tursi, Elisei 2012;
    Tursi, Elisei, Giorgetti 2014). Early research suggests curcumin is safe and effective at preventing relapse when used with anti-inflammatory drugs to
    manage IBD (Baliga 2012).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Boswellia extract.</strong>
    Resin from the <em>Boswellia serrata</em> tree contains a powerful anti-inflammatory compound called <em>acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid, </em>or AKBA
    (Siddiqui 2011). One randomized controlled trial found that <em>Boswellia </em>extract was as effective as mesalamine at improving symptoms of Crohn’s
    disease with far fewer side effects (Gerhardt 2001). In another trial, <em>Boswellia</em> extract was compared to the medication sulfasalazine (Azulfidine)
    in 30 patients with chronic colitis. Seventy percent of those treated with <em>Boswellia</em> extract entered remission compared to only 40% in the
    sulfasalazine group (Gupta 2001). This confirmed an earlier report of <em>Boswellia</em>’s efficacy in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (Gupta 1997). In
    a preclinical model of intestinal inflammation, both <em>Boswellia</em> extract and pure AKBA protected against oxidative damage and prevented
    inflammatory, structural, and functional changes in cells of the intestinal lining that were exposed to inflammatory stimuli (Catanzaro 2015). An improved
    extract, called AprèsFlex, or Aflapin, which combines AKBA with other non-volatile <em>Boswellia</em> oils, has demonstrated improved anti-inflammatory
    activity at a lower concentration when compared to other preparations standardized to the same percentage of AKBA (Sengupta 2011).
</p>
<h2>
    Additional Support
</h2>

<p>
    <strong>L-glutamine</strong>
    . The amino acid L-glutamine is an important energy source for cells that line the intestinal mucosa (Peng 2004; Fleming 1997). L-glutamine has been
    extensively studied for its ability to preserve structural and functional health of the intestine, and to promote intestinal recovery during and after
    injury or stress, such as occurs in infection or surgery. Animal and laboratory studies show the potential for L-glutamine, by protecting cells from
    inflammatory damage, to be a useful therapeutic for IBD (Xue 2011). Because of the relationship between chronic mucosal inflammation and diverticular
    disease, and the frank tissue injury that occurs with acute diverticulitis, L-glutamine may also be helpful in treating these conditions; however, clinical
    studies are needed to clarify the therapeutic role of L-glutamine in diverticular disease.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Mucilaginous herbs.</strong>
Mucilages are complex sugars found in many plants that form a thick, gel-like film when mixed with water (Watts 2012). Psyllium seed husk (<em>Plantago psyllium</em>), flaxseed (<em>Linum usitatissimum</em>), and the medicinal plants slippery elm (<em>Ulmus fulva</em>) and licorice (<em>Glycyrrhiza glabra</em>) contain mucilage (Saeedi 2010; Dugani 2008; Gill 1946; Shenefelt 2011; Alok 2014).
</p>
<p>
    When ingested, mucilages are believed to form a barrier or lining on the intestinal mucosa, protecting against infection and injury, soothing irritation,
    and promoting tissue healing (Pengelly 2006). Slippery elm bark, for example, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in laboratory studies, and appears
    to protect against mucosal hypersensitivity in animal studies, while deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) has demonstrated an ability to help heal peptic
    ulcers (Langmead 2002; Watts 2012). These protective properties of mucilaginous herbs may play a role in helping soothe and heal irritated or inflamed
    tissues lining the digestive tract in diverticular disease; however, clinical trials demonstrating such beneficial effects are needed.

    Inflammatory Bowel Disease protocol may not have been directly studied in people with diverticular disease, the emergence of inflammation as an important

"<div><a name=""Diagnosis"" id=""Diagnosis""></a>


  <p>Silent gallstones are often found on an  abdominal ultrasound that is done for other reasons (Zakko 2018). In symptomatic cases, history-taking and a physical  exam are essential to making an accurate diagnosis. Lab tests and imaging are  used to confirm the presence of suspected gallstones and help determine whether  they are the cause of the presenting symptoms (Zakko  2018; Chen 2012; Wang 2009).</p>
  <p>Patients with acute cholecystitis may have  fever, jaundice, and strong pain when the upper-right abdomen is pressed while  the patient takes a deep breath, which is known as Murphy's sign. These and  other signs and symptoms, such as a rapid heart rate and low blood pressure,  indicate the possibility of other gallstone-related complications (Shaffer 2018; Tanaja 2018; Indar 2002).</p>
  <h2>Differential  Diagnosis</h2>
  <p>Several other conditions are important to keep  in mind as potential causes of upper-abdominal pain that may resemble symptoms  caused by gallstones. These include peptic ulcer disease, non-gallstone-related  acute cholecystitis, and non-gallstone-related pancreatitis (Shaffer 2018). Other conditions that can mimic  biliary pain include heart attack, aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, gastritis,  and hepatitis (Portincasa 2006).</p>
  <h2>Laboratory  Tests</h2>
  <p>Certain blood tests may help with diagnosis,  including (Shaffer 2018; Resnick 2016): </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Complete Blood Count (CBC): The number  of white blood cells is often elevated in patients with gallstone  complications.</li>
    <li>Alanine Transaminase (ALT) and  Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP): Elevated blood levels of these enzymes can be a  sign of biliary obstruction. Typically, ALT levels rise quickly and ALP levels  rise later. </li>
    <li>Bilirubin: Blood bilirubin level is  usually elevated if a bile duct is obstructed.</li>
    <li>Amylase and Lipase: Elevated levels of  these pancreatic enzymes suggest pancreatitis.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Imaging</h2>
  <p>The best initial test for diagnosing  gallstones is an abdominal ultrasound (Shaffer 2018;  Tanaja 2018). It is highly accurate for detecting stones, can detect sludge  as well as stones as small as 2 mm, and identify the presence of acute  cholecystitis (Jones, Ghassemzadeh 2018).  The ultrasound exam may also detect a dilation of the common bile duct, raising  the suspicion of a bile duct stone, obstruction, or tumor (Tanaja 2018; Fogel 2016). </p>
  <p>Gallstones with a substantial calcium content  may be visible on an X-ray. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI) can also detect gallstones, but are less likely than ultrasound  to find acute cholecystitis (Jones, Ghassemzadeh  2018). A CT scan may help identify complications such as an abscess or  perforation (Shaffer 2018).</p>
  <p>A cholescintigraphy scan, also known as a  hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid or HIDA scan, is performed by injecting a  radioactive tracer into the blood to evaluate the state of the gallbladder.  This scan is used to confirm an unclear diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (Tanaja 2018). A HIDA scan can also be useful  for diagnosing chronic cholecystitis and gallbladder motility disorders not  related to gallstones (Jones, Ferguson 2018;  Goussous 2014).</p>
  <p>If ultrasound findings suggest there are  gallstones in the common bile duct, an imaging test called magnetic resonance  cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may be used for confirmation (Jones, Ghassemzadeh 2018). An endoscopic  ultrasound scan may provide similarly useful information, and is generally used  in patients for whom MRCP is not an option, such as those with claustrophobia,  as well as certain implanted devices like heart pacemakers or metal joint  implants (Shaffer 2018; Pan 2016). </p>
  <p>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography  (ERCP) is another useful diagnostic method. ERCP is an invasive test that  involves the use of an injected dye. It can function as both a diagnostic and a  therapeutic procedure and is sometimes used in emergency situations involving  the bile ducts, since stones can be visualized and removed using this procedure  (Shaffer 2018; Tanaja 2018; Lee 2018).</p>
  <div class=""protSidebar"">
    <p></p><h2>Gallbladder  Dyskinesia and Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction</h2>
  <p>Gallbladder motility disorder (dyskinesia) and sphincter of  Oddi dysfunction are conditions that cause biliary symptoms similar to those  caused by gallstones, yet are characterized by the absence of gallstones (Goussous 2014). The sphincter of Oddi is a muscular  ring that sits at the junction of the biliary and pancreatic ducts and controls  the flow of bile and pancreatic enzymes into the small intestine (Toouli 2002; George 2007). Dysfunction of the  sphincter of Oddi can be related to problems with its biliary section,  pancreatic section, or both (Seetharam 2008).  Patients with gallbladder dyskinesia or dysfunction of the biliary section of  the sphincter of Oddi have biliary pain resembling cholecystits (George 2007; Wybourn 2013), while patients  with dysfunction of the pancreatic section of the sphincter of Oddi have pain  that resembles acute pancreatitis (Behar 2006). </p>
  <p>A diagnosis of gallbladder dyskinesia or sphincter of Oddi  dysfunction is generally made after other causes of biliary or pancreatic symptoms  are ruled out, although further tests may be needed for confirmation (Francis 2011; Behar 2006; Vassiliou 2008). The  causes are not well understood, but changes in gallbladder motility are  generally thought to be related to a combination of neuromuscular factors (Vassiliou 2008; Cafasso 2014; Behar 2006).  Cholecystectomy provides partial or total relief of symptoms in over 85% of  patients with gallbladder dyskinesia, as opposed to the nearly 100% success  rate reported in patients with gallstone disease (Goussous 2014). Sphincterotomy, a surgery that involves cutting  the sphincter, may be an option in severe cases of sphincter of Oddi  dysfunction (Toouli 2002; Behar 2006).</p></div>

"<div><a name=""progression"" id=""progression""></a>
<p>Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men. Yet, only about <strong>15% </strong>of new prostate cancer diagnoses require immediate and aggressive treatment (Bastian 2012; CDC 2013b). </p>
<p>The majority of newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases have low- or intermediate-risk malignancies. For men with low risk malignancies, oncologists sometimes practice “watchful waiting” or “active surveillance,” monitoring parameters such as <strong>prostate-specific antigen </strong>(PSA) to evaluate tumor progression (Loeb, Berglund 2013; Bul 2012). This approach can delay the need for aggressive treatment, and in many cases is turning out to reduce or eliminate the need for surgery, chemo-, or radiation therapy (Loeb, Berglund 2013). </p>
<p>During this period of watchful waiting, there is an additional option that has been shown to lower PSA. A landmark study from the United Kingdom has demonstrated that a combination of four foods—a fruit (pomegranate), an herb (green tea), a spice (turmeric), and a vegetable (broccoli)—concentrated into a pill, <strong>dramatically slowed markers of prostate cancer growth by a median of nearly 64% </strong>(Thomas 2013). </p>
<p>Working closely with the <strong>National Cancer Research Network</strong>, this formula was developed based on extensive documentation showing how certain <strong>foods </strong>function to slow prostate cancer growth. We begin this report with a critical review of this groundbreaking study conducted on human prostate cancer patients. </p>

<p>PSA and PSA kinetics are the primary markers to follow disease progress in men with known cancer of the prostate gland (Ilic 2013; Van Neste 2012). But PSA is more than just a marker; we now realize that it is an enzyme that degrades the matrix proteins holding cells together (Pezzato 2004). That is one way the cancer invades and spreads. </p>
<p>A tumor that produces a rapidly rising PSA, therefore, is one at risk for breaking out of the prostate gland itself and spreading either into local tissue or forming distant metastases, both of which place the patient at high risk of death (Benchikh 2008). </p>
<p>That’s why physicians and patients should follow PSA levels carefully once a prostate tumor has been discovered. And that’s why therapies that lower PSA are not just producing an encouraging marker, they are in fact demonstrably slowing disease progression and lowering the patient’s risk of dying. </p></div></div>
<h2>Landmark UK Study: Food Pill Slows Evidence Of Prostate Cancer Growth </h2>
<p>In June of 2013, the <strong>American Society of Clinical Oncology </strong>included in its program a report on a “food pill” that had a dramatic impact on men with prostate cancer (Thomas 2013). For those who don’t know, the annual conference of the <strong>American Society of Clinical Oncology </strong>(ASCO) is where many cancer treatment breakthroughs are announced to the world. </p>
<p>The study reported at the <strong>ASCO </strong>conference was an exploration of the role of four polyphenol-rich <strong>foods </strong>with known anti-cancer properties (Thomas 2013). The trial development team worked in partnership with the UK government’s <strong>National Cancer Research Network</strong>, which ensured the highest scientific credibility and quality assurance. They extensively scrutinized the clinical and laboratory data for foods that have a high chance of an anti-cancer effect. They came up with a specific blend of four cancer-fighting foods concentrated into a capsule designed to be taken twice daily. They then set out to test its effect in the most rigorous of scientific trials—a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial within which they examined its effect on <strong>prostate-specific antigen</strong>, or <strong>PSA</strong>. </p>
<p>The researchers recruited 203 men aged 53 to 89 years (average age 74 years) with prostate cancer proven by biopsy (Thomas 2013). Fifty-nine percent of the men had not yet undergone any treatment and were being followed closely with periodic PSA measurements, while <strong>41% </strong>had already had a radical intervention (surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation) but had relapsed with climbing PSA levels. </p>
<p>The subjects were then randomly assigned to receive either a twice-daily oral capsule containing a blend of <strong>pomegranate seed</strong>, <strong>green tea</strong>, <strong>turmeric</strong>, and <strong>broccoli</strong>, or an identical placebo for 6 months. At baseline, there were no significant differences between the two groups, except that the placebo group was on average 4 years older than the treatment group. Neither the doctors supervising the trial nor the men knew whether they were taking a placebo or the test product. </p>
<p>The men in the study had their PSA levels measured at baseline, at 3 months, and at 6 months, to determine the rate of rise. The results were remarkable. </p>
<p>In the placebo group, PSA levels rose by a median of <strong>78.5% </strong>over the 6-month period, while in the supplemented group, PSA rose by a median of only <strong>14.7%, </strong>a statistically significant <strong>63.8% </strong>difference (Thomas 2013). </p>
<p>In addition, and importantly, <strong>46% </strong>of men in the supplemented group had a stable or lower PSA by the end of the study, compared with just <strong>14% </strong>of the placebo group; again, this was a significant difference, and suggested that in nearly half of the treated men, their cancers had stopped growing or had even regressed. </p>
<p>In another remarkable measure, just <strong>7.4% </strong>of supplemented men being monitored by active surveillance or watchful waiting required a change in management plan, while <strong>26% </strong>of those in the placebo group required a change in their management plan (Thomas 2013). In other words, the supplement directly supported the decision to defer care and avoid painful, costly, and invasive procedures in this group of men. </p>
<p>Following the success of this trial, the research team is designing a range of new scientific trials involving this unique fruit and vegetable blend collaborating with academic cancer centers across the world. These include men already taking androgen deprivation therapies, or those in PSA remission following successful primary treatments such as surgery, brachytherapy, or radiotherapy. They are also partnering with clinicians outside the urology cancer field to determine its effect on osteoarthritis, chronic breast pain, hot flushes, and even tinnitus, and hopefully the results of these trials will be available by early 2015. </p>
<p>Let’s now look more closely at each of the ingredients in this new prostate-cancer-fighting food pill, to see what each one brings uniquely to the formula and how each reinforces the other to reduce the risk of prostate cancer progression.</p>

<ul><li>Prostate cancer becomes a killer when it invades or metastasizes; prior to those events it can be detected and successfully treated. </li>
<li>But too many men with prostate cancer undergo needless and invasive surgery, chemo-, or radiation therapy. </li>
<li>A new pill containing concentrated forms of four functional foods has now been shown to significantly slow the rise of PSA, the major marker of prostate cancer progression. </li>
<li>The components, pomegranate, green tea, turmeric, and broccoli, have all independently been shown to have protective effects on prostate tissue; a new study demonstrates that they can work together in concert to slow the disease in men who already have prostate cancer. </li>

<li>Using all four in one simple pill optimizes both prevention and treatment of prostate cancer, without significant side effects. </li></ul></div></div>
<h3>Pomegranate </h3>
<p>Pomegranate compounds suppress enzymes in the intestine and liver that convert certain molecules (procarcinogens) into cancer-causing agents (Faria 2007; Saruwatari 2008). As it relates to those with prostate cancer, the active constituents in pomegranate have proven to be potent inducers of malignant cell death through <strong>apoptosis</strong> (Vicinanza 2013; Sineh Sepehr 2012; Lee ST 2012; Gasmi 2010; Adhami 2009; Pantuck 2006; Malik 2006; Malik 2005; Albrecht 2004). </p>
<p>During the development of androgen independence, prostate cancer cells are known to increase testosterone synthesis inside their own cells, which maintains cancer cell growth in the absence of significant amounts of circulating testosterone. Overexpression of the <strong><em>androgen receptor </em></strong>occurs in androgen-independent prostate cancer and has been proposed as another mechanism promoting the development of androgen independence. Pomegranate has been shown to inhibit expression of the <strong><em>androgen receptor </em></strong>and <strong><em>androgen synthesizing genes </em></strong>in prostate cells, which helps block an important survival mechanism utilized by prostate cancer cells to escape eradication (Hong 2008). </p>
<p>Multiple basic laboratory and human studies have demonstrated that pomegranate treatment, specifically various active compounds, slows PSA doubling time and reduces production of PSA in malignant prostate cells (Adhami 2009; Malik 2006; Paller 2013; Seeram 2007). </p>
<p>In one recent study, pomegranate juice treatment in men with rising PSA after surgery or radiotherapy resulted in a significant delay in PSA doubling time (the time it takes PSA levels to rise) from a mean of <strong>15 months </strong>before treatment to <strong>54 months </strong>following supplementation (Malik 2006). Another study found a more modest, but still significant delay in doubling time, from <strong>11.9 </strong>months to <strong>18.8 </strong>months (Paller 2013). </p>
<p>Animal studies demonstrate additional anti-cancer activity in pomegranates. In a specialized mouse model of prostate cancer, <strong>100% </strong>of untreated mice developed palpable tumors within 20 weeks, compared to as low as <strong>20% </strong>in the group treated with pomegranate extract; the treated animals lived for up to a median of <strong>92 weeks</strong>, more than twice as long as the <strong>43 weeks </strong>survived by untreated mice (Adhami 2012). </p>
<p>These remarkable results are observed in part because naturally occurring pomegranate polyphenols are concentrated in prostate tissue, facilitating their protective effects (Seeram 2007). Once in the prostate, these polyphenols selectively inhibit cancer cell proliferation, leaving healthy prostate tissue relatively unaffected (Sineh Sepehr 2012; Hong 2008). This is a potential “epigenetic” effect: pomegranate polyphenols decrease the expression of proteins that cancer cells use to support their rapid rate of replication (Gasmi 2010; Malik 2005; Albrecht 2004; Selvi 2010). </p>
<p>Added prostate cancer-fighting benefits of pomegranate include reduction of the inflammation that drives cancer progression, suppression of new blood vessel growth within a forming prostate tumor, and increased expression of genes that keep cells clumped together normally, thereby inhibiting the invasive potential of prostate cancer (Pantuck 2006; Sartippour 2008; Wang 2012; Pitchakarn 2013). </p>
<h3>Green Tea </h3>
<p>Green tea makes a unique contribution to the prostate-cancer-fighting pill as a result of a special combination of naturally occurring polyphenols called <em>catechins</em> (Connors 2012; McCarthy 2007; O’Sullivan 2008; Pezzato 2004). </p>
<p>Studies show that one of green tea’s catechins, <strong>EGCG</strong>, accumulates specifically in prostate tissue, where it selectively kills cancer cells (leaving healthy cells unaffected) and reduces serum PSA levels (Henning 2006; Bettuzzi 2006; Pandey 2009; McLarty 2009; Siddiqui 2006; Chuu 2009). </p>
<p>In a further demonstration of the cancer-suppressing role of green tea, when researchers studied men with a pre-cancerous condition called <em>prostate intraepithelial neoplasia</em>, they found only one tumor after one year in the 30 men given green tea polyphenols, while the 30 placebo recipients developed nine cancers (Bettuzzi 2006). The treatment was safe, and as an extra bonus was found to reduce other lower urinary tract symptoms as well. </p>
<p>Green tea is already acknowledged as a cancer preventive in Japan because of epidemiological studies documenting prostate cancer risk reduction of up to <strong>86% </strong>in men who drink the most green tea (Pandey 2009; Fujiki 2012; Jian 2007; Kurahashi 2008). </p>
<p>Laboratory studies point to still other anti-cancer effects from green tea. Its components reduce genetic expression and activity of androgen receptors that most prostate cancers need to survive (Chuu 2009; Harper 2007; Siddiqui IA 2011; Lee YH 2012). Green tea also induces human cancer cell death by apoptosis through a variety of epigenetic mechanisms (Pitchakarn 2013; Gupta 2012; Hagen 2013). And recent studies reveal polyphenols in brewed green tea shut off new blood vessel growth, important in slowing cancer development (McCarthy 2007). </p>
<h3>Turmeric </h3>
<p>Turmeric’s unique contribution to the prostate-cancer-fighting pill is its extraordinary anti-inflammatory properties, provided chiefly by its natural primary component, <strong>curcumin </strong>(Dorai 2001; Gupta SC 2013). Reducing inflammation with curcumin reduces the metastases that ultimately kill prostate cancer patients (Rao 2012; Cheng 2013; Killian 2012; Sundram 2012). Curcumin also down-regulates genes involved in adhesion, motility, and invasiveness that prostate cancer cells need to invade and spread (Herman 2009). </p>
<p>Curcumin specifically inhibits prostate cancer cell production of PSA by blocking its genetic expression (Yang 2005; Chung 2011). At the same time, it also reduces activation of the androgen receptors on cancer cells that trigger increased production of PSA (Tsui 2008; Choi 2010). </p>
<p>But the whole turmeric root also contains important oils and other substances that enhance curcumin’s absorption and have health benefits of their own, including anti-cancer actions (Aggarwal 2013). </p>
<p>Turmeric’s components also inhibit cancer cell proliferation, restore cancer cells’ ability to die normally by apoptosis, and decrease the density of blood vessels needed for tumor expansion (Dorai 2001). By modulating cell signaling mechanisms, curcumin arrests the out-of-control cell replication cycle typical in cancer (Teiten 2011; Guo 2013). </p>
<p>Curcumin also sensitizes cancer cells to chemo- and radiation therapy, as well as to the intrinsic “death factor” called <strong>TRAIL </strong>(<em>TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand</em>), one of the body’s natural cancer-suppressing mechanisms (Shankar 2008; Chendil 2004; Goel 2010). Remarkably, these sensitizing effects are not found on normal, healthy cells, so they remain protected during treatment (Goel 2010). </p>
<p>The compound has also been found to block growth factors and androgen receptors used by cancer cells to support themselves (Hung 2012; Shah 2012; Teiten 2012). </p>
<h3>Broccoli </h3>
<p>Broccoli’s unique contribution to the prostate-cancer-fighting pill is its ability to up-regulate phase II detoxifying enzymes in gut and liver tissue, enabling the body to render harmless thousands of potentially carcinogenic molecules in our diet (Clarke 2011; Rogan 2006; Joseph 2004; Abdul Razis 2013). In addition, the naturally occurring sulfur-rich broccoli constituents <em>sulforaphane</em>, <em>indole-3-carbinol </em>(I3C), and others have now been identified as potent epigenetic regulators (Clarke 2011; Dashwood 2007; Myzak 2007; Myzak 2006). </p>
<p>These broccoli compounds control enzymes called <em>histone deacetylases </em>(HDAC) that regulate the genes encoded in DNA—including those responsible for promoting or suppressing cancer formation (Clarke 2011; Dashwood 2007; Myzak 2007; Myzak 2006). Known collectively as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, such molecules are prime objectives of Big Pharma (Gryder 2013; Stettner 2012). </p>
<p>Men with high consumption of broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables have a <strong>40% </strong>lower risk of invasive prostate cancer (Kirsh 2007). And in animal studies, broccoli feeding reduced prostate tumor weight by <strong>42% </strong>in prostate cancer-prone mice and suppressed growth of implanted human prostate cancer cells by <strong>40% </strong>(Myzak 2007; Canene-Adams 2007)<strong>.</strong> </p>
<p>Broccoli compounds reduce PSA production as a result of slowing prostate cancer cell replication in laboratory cell culture models (Zhang 2003; Chiao 2002; Han 2007). They appear to inhibit expression of the androgen receptors that prostate cancer needs to survive (Chiao 2002). </p>
<p>Broccoli’s other prostate cancer-fighting properties include inhibition of growth and transcription factors that are activated in malignancies, restoration of normal tumor suppressor genes, and increased production of apoptosis-inducing proteins (Traka 2010; Melchini 2013; Hahm 2010; Choi 2005; Ho 2009; Traka 2008). </p>
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Prostate cancer is a paradox: Its typically slow growth rate makes it possible to treat if discovered early, but once it has metastasized, it is often lethal. </p>
<p>The combination of four widely-recognized cancer-fighting foods, <strong>pomegranate</strong>, <strong>green tea</strong>, <strong>turmeric</strong>, and <strong>broccoli</strong>, in a single twice-daily pill has now been shown to significantly reduce the rate of rise of PSA, the tumor marker that indicates progression and invasion of prostate cancer (Thomas 2013). </p>
<p>This new pill appears to work by providing cancer-suppressing actions at a wide variety of targets. All of this pill’s components have the capacity to cause favorable epigenetic changes, reversing the gene damage that leads to cancer development and restoring normal cancer suppression mechanisms (Gasmi 2010; Malik 2005; Albrecht 2004; Connors 2012; Gupta 2012; Hagen 2013; Herman 2009; Clarke 2011; Dashwood 2007; Myzak 2007; Myzak 2006). </p>
<p>In a tightly controlled clinical trial, putting them together in a single pill was shown to be effective at slowing the growth of existing prostate cancers and preventing surgical and other side effect-prone procedures. </p>
<p>If you or someone you know suffers from prostate cancer, or is interested in preventing it, this new functional food pill, or its individual constituents, should be part of their daily program. </p></div>",https://www.lifeextension.com/Protocols/Cancer/Prostate-Cancer-Prevention/Page-06
"<div><a name=""Conventional%20Treatment"" id=""Conventional Treatment""></a>


  <p>Typically, silent gallstones are left  untreated, but surgery may be considered for individuals deemed to have a high  risk of gallbladder cancer or conditions that increase their risk of gallstone complications,  such as sickle cell disease, a weakened immune system, or an upcoming weight  loss surgery (Shaffer 2018; Fogel 2016).  Dietary, lifestyle, and natural medicine interventions may help people with  silent gallstones avoid progressing to a symptomatic stage of gallstone disease  (Shabanzadeh 2016; Di Ciaula 2017). </p>
  <p>For all forms of symptomatic gallstone  disease, surgery is the mainstay of conventional treatment. </p>
  <h2>Gallbladder  Removal (Cholecystectomy)</h2>
  <p>Acute biliary pain from gallstones, in the  absence of complications, can be treated with pain relievers (Tanaja 2018). Because recurrence is common,  surgical removal of the gallbladder, known as cholecystectomy, is widely  recommended following an acute episode of gallstone cholecystitis (Jones, Ghassemzadeh 2018; Sinha 2002; Acar 2017).  Cholecystectomy is also the treatment of choice for chronic cholecystitis  (inflammation of the gallbladder) (Jones,  Ferguson 2018). </p>
  <p>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which uses a  video camera inserted via small punctures in the abdominal wall, is preferred  for its shorter in-hospital time, shorter post-surgical recovery time, and  lower rates of certain complications. Nonetheless, open cholecystectomy, involving  a larger cut in the abdominal wall, may be necessary in some cases (Shaffer 2018; Zakko 2018; Gomes 2017). About  half of individuals who undergo cholecystectomy experience digestive symptoms  such as loose stools, gas, and bloating following surgery; these symptoms  usually improve over time without treatment (Zakko  2018). </p>
  <h2>Ursodeoxycholic  Acid</h2>
  <p>The bile salt ursodeoxycholic acid (Actigall),  also known as ursodiol, is a naturally-occurring bile salt that decreases liver  secretion of cholesterol, lowers cholesterol saturation in bile, and promotes  the dissolving of cholesterol stones (Portincasa  2012). Ursodeoxycholic acid usually relieves symptoms within two to  three months, but may take years to completely dissolve gallstones (Zakko 2018; Jones, Ghassemzadeh 2018). It is  only effective for treating small, cholesterol-rich, calcium-free stones in people  with a functioning gallbladder and bile duct. Ursodeoxycholic acid has been  reported to have a 90% success rate for dissolving stones with these  characteristics; however, the recurrence rate has been reported to be as high  as 30–50% within five years after treatment. Because of its slow action and  high post-treatment recurrence rate, ursodeoxycholic acid is not widely  recommended, and its use is generally reserved for those who cannot undergo  surgery (Portincasa 2012; Portincasa 2017; Goral  2016). It is also sometimes prescribed after weight loss surgery to  reduce the accompanying risk of gallstone formation (Magouliotis 2017). Mild, temporary diarrhea is the main side  effect of ursodeoxycholic acid (Zakko 2018).</p>
  <h2>Treatment  of Gallstone Complications</h2>
  <p>In patients with gallstones in the common bile  duct (choledocholithiasis), stone removal through a combination procedure  called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with biliary  sphincterotomy (cutting of the muscular sphincter that controls bile flow into  the small intestine) is considered the best option and is the most commonly  used approach. Extra interventions such as stone fragmentation (lithotripsy),  balloon dilation of the opening of the common bile duct into the small  intestine, or propping open (stenting) the common bile duct may be required  along with ERCP if the gallstone is large, impacted, or trapped in front of an  obstruction (Molvar 2016; Shaffer 2018; Sakai  2016). Many patients with a stone in a bile duct also have stones in the  gallbladder; for these individuals, cholecystectomy is generally performed  after ERCP (Shaffer 2018; Baloyiannis 2015).</p>
  <p>Bile duct infection (cholangitis) and  gallstone pancreatitis are dangerous complications that require immediate  attention, including intravenous fluids, pain relievers, and antibiotics. ERCP,  stone removal, and sphincterotomy may be needed, and cholecystectomy will  likely be recommended during the same hospital stay or at a later time (Shaffer 2018; Stinton 2012). Gallstone-related  bowel obstruction (ileus) also requires urgent medical treatment with surgical  stone removal and repair of the intestinal wall, and sometimes cholecystectomy  either as part of the same procedure or later (Turner  2018).</p>
  <h2>Health  Effects of Cholecystectomy</h2>
  <p>After cholecystectomy, patients may experience  short-term digestive problems, such as diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain (Altomare 2017; Zakko 2018). Although  pre-surgery symptoms are effectively relieved in more than 90% of patients  treated with cholecystectomy, a small number of patients develop a set of  symptoms and findings collectively referred to as post-cholecystectomy syndrome  (Jaunoo 2010). Dysfunction of the  sphincter of Oddi, located at the opening of the common bile duct into the  small intestine, is a cause in some cases of post-cholecystectomy syndrome, but  more frequently the cause is an overlooked disorder outside of the biliary  system, such as peptic ulcer, chronic pancreatitis, or irritable bowel  syndrome, or is unknown (Tarnasky 2016; Jaunoo  2010; Shirah 2018). Cholecystectomy is also associated with long-term  increased risk of weight gain and metabolic syndrome, gastritis, and  deficiencies of fat soluble vitamins (ie, vitamins A, D, E and K) (Altomare 2017; Chen 2018).</p>

"<div><a name=""Emerging%20Therapies"" id=""Emerging Therapies""></a>


  <p>Surgery has been the cornerstone of gallstone  treatment for many decades (Fogel 2016),  but researchers continue to search for new drugs, and new ways to use existing  drugs, to prevent gallstones and their complications.</p>
  <h2>Advances  in Non-Surgical Approaches</h2>
  <p>Medications that affect cholesterol metabolism  are currently under investigation for their potential in preventing and  treating gallstone disease:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ursodeoxycholic  acid</strong>. As previously noted, ursodeoxycholic acid (or  Ursodiol) is currently used to treat gallstone disease in patients for whom  surgery is not an option, but widening its use has been proposed, such as to  reduce the risk of gallstone formation during pregnancy or rapid weight loss,  after abdominal surgery, and in infants requiring long-term total parenteral  nutrition (Portincasa 2012; de Bari, Wang, Liu  2014; Stokes 2014; Simic 2014). In addition, synthetic molecules based  on ursodeoxycholic acid but with stronger effects have been developed. It is  speculated that such bile acid derivatives, and possibly other drugs targeting  bile acid activity, may help to better fight gallstone disease (Yu 2016; Halilbasic 2013; Portincasa 2012). </li>
  </ul>
 
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Metformin</strong>.  In a study published in 2017, the long-term use of metformin (Glucophage), an  anti-diabetic medication, was correlated with a lower risk of gallstones in  diabetic subjects (Liao 2017).  Metformin's possible gallstone-preventing effects could be related to its  ability to improve metabolism. There is also evidence that metformin improves  gallbladder motility (Rohde 2016; Isik 2012). </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Statins</strong>.  Statins are a family of medications used to reduce elevated cholesterol levels.  Examples include atorvastatin (Lipitor), simvastatin (Zocor), and rosuvastatin  (Crestor). Statins work in part by interfering with the synthesis of  cholesterol in the liver, and they also reduce the cholesterol saturation of  bile (Cariati 2012; Lioudaki 2011).  Findings from animal studies suggest statins may be effective for reducing  cholesterol gallstone formation. In humans, statin use has been correlated with  a lower risk of gallstone disease and cholecystectomy, but results from  randomized clinical trials so far have been mixed (Portincasa 2012; Kan 2014).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ezetimibe</strong>.  Ezetimibe (Zetia) is a cholesterol-lowering drug that inhibits cholesterol  absorption across the intestinal wall. This leads to reduced cholesterol  secretion by the liver, decreased cholesterol saturation in bile, and  prevention of crystallization in the gallbladder (de Bari 2012; Portincasa 2017). Ezetimibe has been found to  prevent gallstone formation in animal research, including in mice exposed to  high estrogen levels, and is therefore under consideration as an option for preventing  and treating gallstones in humans (de Bari,  Wang, Portincasa 2014; Portincasa 2017).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Because  of their complementary actions, a combination drug (Liptruzet) that contains  atorvastatin and ezetimibe has also been suggested as a possible treatment for  cholesterol gallstones (Husain 2015).</p>
  <h2>Surgical  Advances</h2>
  <p>Surgical approaches are constantly being  refined to reduce invasiveness, improve cosmetic outcomes, reduce  post-operative pain and recovery time, and maximize effectiveness. One  technique that is gaining acceptance is natural orifice transluminal endoscopic  surgery (NOTES) cholecystectomy (Abraham 2014;  Nemani 2014). This procedure involves the use of a flexible endoscope  which is passed through a natural opening in the body, such as the mouth, anus,  or vagina, before crossing into the abdominal cavity (Peng 2016). Most NOTES cholecystectomies are done through the  vagina (Abraham 2014). A recent advance  in NOTES is the addition of laparoscopic assistance, a so-called hybrid NOTES  approach (Bernhardt 2017; Mintz 2007). </p>
  <p>NOTES cholecystectomies have demonstrated a  high degree of safety and a similar complication rate to standard laparoscopic  cholecystectomy. In addition, they may be associated with less post-operative  pain and may result in less analgesic use and better cosmetic appearance than  other types of cholecystectomy (Borchert 2017;  Schwaitzberg 2017; Dhillon 2017; Pohlen 2017). </p>
</div>",https://www.lifeextension.com/Protocols/Gastrointestinal/Gallstones/Page-08
"<div><a name=""Diet%20and%20Lifestyle"" id=""Diet and Lifestyle""></a>


  <p>Dietary factors play an important role in the  development of cholesterol gallstone disease. In general, a high-calorie,  high-fat diet characterized by high intakes of sugar, refined carbohydrates,  saturated fat, cholesterol, and trans fats has been linked to an increased risk  of gallstones and their complications (Compagnucci  2016; Di Ciaula 2017; Di Ciaula 2013; Setiawan 2017). On the other hand,  a diet rich in fiber, fruits and vegetables, plant proteins, and  monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats is protective (Di Ciaula 2017; Gaby 2009; Sachdeva 2011). A Mediterranean-style  diet, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, seafood, legumes, and olive oil, was  associated with reduced cholecystectomy risk in a study in French women (Barre 2017). A high-fiber diet has been found  to prevent gallstones in obese patients undergoing rapid weight loss (Sulaberidze 2014). Some evidence suggests that  some of these dietary factors do not appear to impact gallstone risk in  pregnant women (Mathew 2015; Basso 1992).</p>
  <h2>Judicious  Weight Loss</h2>
  <p>Weight loss is an important strategy for  reducing the risk of gallstones in overweight or obese individuals, yet the  risk of gallstones increases when weight is lost rapidly (Portincasa 2016). In a study with more than  6,000 people participating in one of two weight loss programs, those on a 500  calorie per day diet for three months, followed by nine months of weight  maintenance, were three times more likely to need hospitalization for  symptomatic gallstones or cholecystectomy for gallstones than those who started  with a 1,200–1,500 calorie per day diet. Although the rates of gallstone-related  hospitalization were relatively low in both groups, at 1.5% per year in those  on the very-low-calorie diet and 0.4% per year in those on the low-calorie  diet, the results suggest that the health benefits of weight loss may be best  achieved through modest calorie restriction (Johansson  2014). </p>
  <p>Generally, weight loss of greater than 24% of  initial body weight and at a rate greater than 1.5 kg (about 3.3 pounds) per  week has been identified as a risk factor for gallstones, but the risk may be  mitigated by controlling the rate of weight loss, reducing the length of the  overnight fast, and keeping a small amount of fat (at least 7 grams per day) in  the diet to improve gallbladder motility (Erlinger  2000).</p>
  <h2>Specific  Foods</h2>
  <p>Coffee and tea appear to reduce the risk of  gallstones, possibly by stimulating gallbladder activity (Zhang 2006; Zhang 2015). Moderate alcohol  intake, which may stimulate gallbladder emptying, has also been associated with  a lower gallstone risk (Mostofsky 2016; Walcher  2010). Foods that contain polyunsaturated fats (eg, fish) and  monounsaturated fats (eg, olive oil and nuts) appear to be protective as well (Misciagna 1996; Brown 2017; Alarcon de la Lastra  2001). In a study that followed over 80,000 women for 20 years, eating  five or more servings of nuts per week was associated with a 25% lower risk of  cholecystectomy (Tsai 2004a). Similarly,  a study that followed over 43,000 men for more than 10 years identified a 30%  lower gallstone risk in those eating five or more servings of nuts per week  compared with those who rarely or never ate nuts (Ros 2010; Tsai 2004b).</p>
  <p>Garlic, onions, fenugreek, and components from  other dietary spices including turmeric, cayenne, and black pepper have each  demonstrated the ability to prevent and dissolve cholesterol gallstones in  animal studies. Preclinical research suggests they reduce cholesterol  saturation in bile and inhibit the first stage of cholesterol crystal formation  (Song 2015; Shubha 2011; Reddy 2011a; Reddy 2011b;  Vidyashankar 2010a; Vidyashankar 2010b).</p>
  <div class=""protSidebar"">
<h2>Gallbladder  Flushing</h2>
  <p>The “gallbladder flush” is a folk remedy for  gallstones that has been popularized through natural health websites and books.  The process recommended for gallbladder flushing varies, but usually entails a  12 to 24-hour fast, ending in the evening with the ingestion of a large volume  of olive oil and lemon juice. Typically, anywhere from 2/3 to 2 cups of olive  oil and 1/3 to 1/2 cup of lemon juice are ingested over several hours. The  expectation is that gallstones will be passed the following morning (Sies 2005; Gaby 2009).</p>
  <p>In one case report, a number of firm, green  globules collected by an individual who had performed a gallbladder flush were  analyzed and found to have none of the major components of  gallstones—cholesterol, bilirubin, or calcium. Instead, they were composed mainly  of fatty acids, presumably from the olive oil itself. Further examination  suggested that the globules may have been soaps created by the action of  digestive enzymes on the olive oil-lemon juice combination (Sies 2005). Nevertheless, there are several  reports of cases in which fewer gallstones were seen on ultrasound after,  compared with before, gallbladder flushing (Gaby  2009).</p>
  <p>To date, the various methods promoted to  “flush” gallstones have not been validated in controlled clinical trials and  are not evidence-based.</p>
	</div>
  <h2>Physical  Activity</h2>
  <p>A sedentary lifestyle increases the risk of  cholesterol gallstones, while being physically active decreases the risk (Stinton 2012). Physical activity may prevent  cholesterol gallstone formation by improving gut motility and through positive  effects on cholesterol metabolism (Pak 2016).  A systematic review and meta-analysis that included eight studies and a  combined total of almost 7,000 participants concluded that those with the  highest physical activity level had a 25% lower risk of gallbladder disease,  including gallstones and cholecystitis, than those with the lowest physical  activity level (Aune 2016). Exercise may  prevent silent gallstones (Henao-Moran 2014)  as well as gallstone complications (Shabanzadeh,  Sorensen, Jorgensen 2017a). Two to three hours of recreational physical  activity each week may reduce the risk of cholecystectomy by about 20% (Pak 2016).</p>
</div>",https://www.lifeextension.com/Protocols/Gastrointestinal/Gallstones/Page-09
"<div><a name=""Integrative%20Interventions"" id=""Integrative Interventions""></a>


  <p>Nutritional supplements hold much promise in  preventing cholesterol gallstones and their complications. Individuals with a  high gallstone risk due to ethnicity, gender, age, family history, or other  health and medical factors, and those with known silent gallstones, may want to  consider supplements to possibly reduce their risk. </p>
  <h2>Primary  Suggestions</h2>
  <p><strong>Vitamin  C</strong> <br>
    Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that is  well known for neutralizing free radicals and decreasing oxidative stress, a  contributing factor in gallstone formation (Sanikidze  2016; del Pozo 2014). Vitamin C is also needed for the conversion of  cholesterol into bile acids (Gaby 2009).  The ability of vitamin C to prevent gallstone formation is supported by several  animal studies. A relationship between vitamin C deficiency and gallstones has  been recognized since the 1970s (Ginter 1971)  and, for decades, low intake has been implicated in raising cholesterol  saturation in the bile and in increasing the likelihood of gallstone formation (Simon 1993; Worthington 1997; Ginter 1973).</p>
  <p>In a controlled clinical trial, 16 gallstone  patients scheduled for cholecystectomy were given 500 mg of supplemental  vitamin C four times daily for two weeks before surgery. Compared with similar  patients who did not supplement with vitamin C, the study subjects had improved  bile composition and a lengthening of the time required for cholesterol  crystals to form (Gustafsson 1997).  Another trial found a similar effect in 13 patients awaiting cholecystectomy  who were taking 1 gram of vitamin C twice daily (del  Pozo 2014). In an observational study of 2,129 subjects, regular vitamin  C users were 66% less likely to have gallstones than non-vitamin C users when  assessed by abdominal ultrasound (Walcher 2009).  The correlation between vitamin C levels and gallstone risk appears to be  stronger in women than in men (Simon 2000; Simon  1998; Ortega 1997). </p>
  <p><strong>Fish  Oil and Omega-3 Fatty Acids</strong> <br>
    Supplementing with fish oil or omega-3  polyunsaturated fatty acids from fish (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and  docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) may prevent gallstones by improving bile  composition and preventing crystal formation (Berr  1992; Jonkers 2006; Cho 2015; Pasternak 2017). In a double-blind  placebo-controlled trial, 35 obese women with no history of gallstones or  cholecystectomy were treated with a 1,200 calorie per day diet, along with  either 11.3 grams per day of omega-3 fats from fish, ursodeoxycholic acid, or  placebo for six weeks. While on the diet, the time needed for cholesterol crystals  to form decreased in the placebo and ursodeoxycholic acid groups, but not in  the omega-3 group, suggesting fish oil may prevent the increase in gallstone  risk seen with low-calorie weight loss dieting (Mendez-Sanchez  2001).</p>
  <p><strong>S-Adenosylmethionine  (SAMe)</strong> <br>
    S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) exerts protective  effects on the liver and improves bile flow in people with certain liver  diseases (Almasio 1990). In a preliminary  study that included seven women with a history of biliary problems during  pregnancy, taking 800 mg oral SAMe daily for two weeks resulted in decreased  cholesterol saturation in the bile (Frezza 1988).  In a trial in six healthy women who had experienced an increase in bile  cholesterol saturation after starting oral contraceptives, the addition of 600  mg SAMe daily for two cycles of contraceptive use reduced this effect (Di Padova 1984).</p>
  <p><strong>Curcumin </strong> <br>
    Curcumin is a carotenoid extracted from  turmeric. Several animal studies suggest curcumin may reduce the likelihood of gallstone  formation by improving cholesterol and lipid metabolism (Srinivasan 2017). Curcumin has also been shown to enhance  gallbladder motility (Rasyid 2002; Rasyid 1999),  reduce gallbladder inflammation, and normalize bile acid metabolism (Yang 2016). In mice fed a high-fat  high-cholesterol diet, curcumin protected against the development of  gallstones, and its effect was enhanced with the addition of piperine, an  alkaloid from black pepper (Li 2015).</p>
  <p>Curcumin may also be helpful in recovery after  cholecystectomy. In a randomized controlled trial, 50 patients undergoing  laparoscopic cholecystectomy were given either curcumin or a placebo, along  with standard pain relievers to use as needed, upon hospital discharge. The  curcumin group had less post-operative pain and fatigue and used less pain-relieving  medication than the placebo group (Agarwal 2011).</p>
  <p>Curcumin has been shown in a few studies to  promote gallbladder contraction (Rasyid 1999; Rasyid 2002). Therefore, people  with a history of bile duct obstruction or who have an active obstruction  should avoid curcumin. </p>
  <h2>Additional  Suggestions</h2>
  <p><strong>Iron</strong> <br>
    Individuals with iron-deficiency anemia have  been found to have a higher risk of gallstones than those with normal iron  levels (Pamuk 2009). This relationship  has been verified in the reverse as well: gallstone patients have been found to  be more likely to have low serum iron levels than healthy individuals (Prasad 2015). On the other hand,  concentrations of iron in the blood and bile have been reported to be significantly  higher in people with pigment gallstones (Khan  2017), which are often related to conditions marked by increased red  blood cell breakdown (Stinton 2012).</p>
  <p>Iron deficiency may alter the activities of  several liver enzymes, leading to increased cholesterol saturation in bile and increased  cholesterol crystallization, and it also negatively impacts gallbladder  motility (Prasad 2015). In addition, it  is possible that gallstone disease contributes to iron malabsorption and poor  iron status (Saboor 2015). </p>
  <p>Different forms of dietary iron may have  varying impacts on gallstone formation. One study followed over 44,000 men for  16 years and examined their iron consumption using a food questionnaire.  Participants with the highest intake of heme iron, a well-absorbed,  protein-bound form of iron found in meat and seafood, had a 21% higher risk of  symptomatic gallstones compared with those with the lowest intake, but there  was no significant link between the intake of non-heme iron, which is found  predominantly in plant-based foods, and symptomatic gallstones (Tsai 2007). Dietary heme iron has also been  shown to increase the burden of oxidative stress in the body (Romeu 2013). </p>
  <p>Because of the role of excess iron in raising  oxidative stress and the risk of cardiovascular disease, it is important to  have one’s iron status assessed before taking an iron supplement (Kraml 2017). Only those with iron deficiency  should consider iron supplementation to reduce the risk of gallstones.</p>
  <p><strong>Vitamin  E</strong> <br>
    Vitamin E is a fat-soluble nutrient that helps  prevent and repair oxidative damage to lipids in the body. Vitamin E is a term  that collectively refers to four tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta)  and four tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta), with alpha-tocopherol  being the predominant form in the body (Jiang  2001; Jiang 2014). Observational studies have noted that individuals  with gallstones have lower blood levels of alpha-tocopherol and  alpha-tocopherol/cholesterol ratios, and lower dietary intake of  alpha-tocopherol, as compared with unaffected individuals (Waniek 2018; Worthington 1997; Worthington 2004).  Since oxidative stress is one of the factors believed to contribute to a higher  risk of gallstones, supplementing with vitamin E may be beneficial for  preventing gallstones (Waniek 2018; Sanikidze  2016).</p>
  <p><strong>Epigallocatechin  Gallate (EGCG)</strong> <br>
    Epigallocatechin gallate, or EGCG, is a green  tea flavonoid. EGCG has demonstrated gallstone-preventing effects in a mouse  model of gallstone disease, possibly through its anti-inflammatory activity (Shan 2008). Findings from a population-based  case-control study in China suggest drinking tea may reduce the risks of  gallstone disease and gallbladder cancer (Zhang  2006). However, other research has not found a clear connection between  tea drinking and gallstones (Ishizuk 2003).</p>
  <p><strong>Melatonin</strong> <br>
    Melatonin, a neuro-hormone produced in the  pineal gland, may have a role in gallstone disease prevention or treatment due  to its anti-inflammatory and free-radical-scavenging properties, as well as its  beneficial effect on gallbladder muscle tone (Pozo  2010; Koppisetti 2008). In animal and laboratory research, melatonin has  been shown to reverse age-related muscle dysfunction of the gallbladder and  improve inflammation and gallbladder function in acute cholecystitis (Gomez-Pinilla 2006; Gomez-Pinilla 2007; Gomez-Pinilla  2008). In a guinea pig model, the administration of melatonin prevented  the formation of pigment gallstones (Shiesh  2000).</p>
  <p><strong>Milk  Thistle</strong> <br>
    Silymarin, a flavonoid extract from milk  thistle (<em>Silybum marianum</em>), has been  shown to counteract the negative impact of estrogen on bile flow in rats (Crocenzi 2001). Silymarin and silybin, its  major active component, have also been noted to reduce bile cholesterol content  in both rats and human subjects (Nassuato 1983;  Nassuato 1991), suggesting its potential value in gallstone prevention  and treatment.</p>

  <h2> What is Muscular Dystrophy?
  </h2>
<p>
    The term “muscular dystrophy” refers to a group of different genetic
    diseases that all result in muscular deterioration over time. Most
    commonly, the muscles in the arms and legs are weakened initially, but
    sometimes weakening of the heart muscles (cardiomyopathy) or other muscles
    occurs as well. Respiratory failure is common in late-stage muscular
    dystrophy and is a frequent cause of death.
</p>
<p>
    There is currently no cure for muscular dystrophy. However, new research is
    uncovering particular genetic mutations associated with different types of
    muscular dystrophy; these not only help diagnose the different forms of the
    disease, but also with potential emerging therapies.
</p>
<p>
    Several natural interventions such as coenzyme Q10 and creatine may help
    complement conventional treatments and improve quality of life.
</p>
<h2> What are the Signs and Symptoms of Muscular Dystrophy?
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: There are many types of muscular dystrophy, and they can present
    different symptoms and appear at different stages in life. The following
    are some common symptoms:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Difficulty walking or getting up from a seated position </li>
  <li> Walking on tiptoes (in children learning to walk) </li>
  <li>
    Enlarged calf muscles
  </li>
  <li>
    Waddling gait
  </li>
  <li>
    Learning disabilities
  </li>
  <li>
    Gastrointestinal complaints
  </li>
  <li>
     Weakening muscles (different diseases will affect different muscles)
  </li>
  <li> In certain forms of the disease, difficulty swallowing and keeping eyes
    open/closed </li>
  <li>
    Hearing loss beginning in infancy
  </li>
  <li>
    Abnormal heart rhythm
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What are the Conventional Medical Treatments for Muscular Dystrophy?
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: There is currently no cure for muscular dystrophy. However, certain
    therapies described below may help delay symptoms and improve muscle
    function. </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Physical therapy
  </li>
  <li>
    Corticosteroids
  </li>
  <li> Other treatments are also available to help manage the side effects of
    muscular dystrophy, including drugs to block muscle spasms, antiepileptics,
    surgery for scoliosis, and other supportive care. </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are Emerging Therapies to Treat Muscular Dystrophy?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Exon skipping is an investigational technique that can help compensate
    for the mutations in the dystrophin gene that cause dysfunctional muscle
    proteins </li>
  <li> Proteasome inhibitors to prevent breakdown of muscle proteins </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Can Help Manage Muscular Dystrophy?
</h2>
<p>
    Dietary and lifestyle changes cannot directly impact muscular degradation.
    However, many people with muscular dystrophy have limited mobility, which
    makes proper nutrition essential. A high-fiber, high-protein, low-calorie
    diet with proper fluid intake is recommended for many patients with
    muscular dystrophy.
</p>
<h2> 
        What Natural Interventions Can Help Manage Muscular Dystrophy?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Coenzyme Q10</strong>. Coenzyme Q10, in combination with corticosteroid treatment, may help
    increase muscle strength. </li>
  <li><strong>Resveratrol</strong>. In animal models of muscular dystrophy, resveratrol treatment
    decreased inflammation and protected the hearts against enlargement and
    fibrosis. </li>
  <li><strong>Creatine</strong>. Treatment with creatine, alone or in combination with
    corticosteroids, lengthened the time for patients to fatigue and
    increased muscle strength. </li>
  <li><strong>Omega-3 fatty acids</strong>. In animal models of muscular dystrophy, a diet rich in omega-3 fatty
    acids prevented degeneration of skeletal muscle. </li>
  <li><strong>Vitamin D </strong>
    and <strong>calcium</strong>. Vitamin D and calcium are essential for
    muscle and bone function. Decreased bone density is common in some
    forms of muscular dystrophy, and increasing vitamin D and calcium
    levels improved bone mass in some patients.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Taurine</strong>. Taurine, alone or in combination with corticosteroids, improved
    functional measures of muscle health in an animal model. </li>
  <li><strong>Glutamine</strong>. Glutamine supplementation in patients with the most common form of
    muscular dystrophy was associated with inhibition of protein
    degradation. </li>
  <li>
     Other promising natural interventions for muscular dystrophy include<strong> L-carnitine</strong>, <strong>melatonin</strong>,<strong> green tea</strong>, <strong>vitamin E</strong> and    <strong>selenium</strong>, and <strong>N-acetylcysteine</strong>.

  <h2> What is Rheumatoid Arthritis?
  </h2>
<p>
    Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease that causes
    pain and disfigurement of peripheral joints. The disease may alternate
    between “flares” and periods of remission, but is generally progressive.
    Importantly, patients with RA are at a significantly higher risk of
    cardiovascular disease.
</p>
<p>
    The disease is characterized by an autoimmune response that can damage
    joints and cause systemic inflammation. The inflammation is caused by the
    immune system mistakenly attacking the soft tissue in joints, causing
    damage and dysfunction.
</p>
<p>
Natural interventions like <strong>curcumin</strong>,<em><strong> Boswellia serrata</strong></em><strong> extract</strong><strong>,</strong> and <strong>white peony extract</strong> may help reduce
    inflammation and improve overall health in patients with RA.
</p>
<h2> What are the Signs and Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Joint inflammation (swollen, warm, painful)—may be worse in the morning </li>
  <li>
    Fatigue
  </li>
  <li>
    Malaise
  </li>
  <li>
    Weight loss
  </li>
  <li> Damage to other areas of the body may occur as well. Some symptoms may
    include ulcers on the skin, coughing or shortness of breath, high
    cholesterol, and anemia. </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What are the Conventional Medical Treatments for Rheumatoid Arthritis?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (eg,
    methotrexate and sulfasalazine) </li>
  <li>
    Glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone)
  </li>
  <li>
    Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
  </li>
  <li>
    Statins to prevent cardiovascular disease
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are Emerging Therapies for Rheumatoid Arthritis?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Modified-release prednisone to improve on the action of conventional
    prednisone </li>
  <li>
    Stem cell treatment
  </li>
  <li>
    Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Can Benefit Rheumatoid Arthritis?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Avoid foods that cause sensitivities (elevated IgG antibodies) </li>
  <li> Exercise (dynamic aerobic exercise and/or strength training) </li>
</ul>

<h2> 
  What Natural Interventions May Benefit Rheumatoid Arthritis?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Undenatured type-II collagen</strong>. When immune cells encounter exposed joint collagen in RA patients, an
    autoimmune attack is launched, resulting in inflammation. Consuming
    undenatured type-II collagen may help the immune system develop “oral
    tolerance,” teaching the T cells to ignore collagen encountered in
    joints. </li>
  <li><strong>Essential fatty acids</strong>. Omega-3 and certain omega-6 fatty acids are recommended for many RA
    patients because they can reduce inflammation and improve
    cardiovascular health. Fatty acids derived from fish oil have been
    shown to reduce RA pain and improve cholesterol and triglyceride
    levels. </li>
  <li><strong>Vitamin D</strong>. Vitamin D plays an immunomodulatory role and can improve pain relief
    in RA patients taking DMARDs. </li>
  <li><strong>Vitamin B6</strong>. Treatment with vitamin B6 reduced levels of pro-inflammatory
    cytokines in patients with RA. Patients with RA are also more likely to
    be deficient in vitamin B6. </li>
  <li><strong>White peony extract</strong>. Multiple studies have shown that white peony extract has
    immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and pain-relieving activity. The
    extract can reduce symptoms on its own and improve patient response to
    other treatments. </li>
  <li><strong>Curcumin</strong>. Curcumin is a well-known anti-inflammatory compound. It has been
    shown to be as effective as an NSAID in treating RA-related activity. </li>
  <li><em><strong>Boswellia serrata</strong></em>
    <strong> extract</strong>. The anti-inflammatory extract of the Boswellia sacra tree can improve
      joint flexion, reduce swelling, and prevent cartilage degradation in
      arthritic patients.<strong></strong>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pomegranate</strong>. Pomegranates are rich in antioxidant polyphenols. Animal studies and
    small clinical trials have demonstrated pomegranate’s ability to help
    with arthritic pain and inflammation.<strong></strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Other plant extracts and compounds such as<strong> andrographis</strong>, <strong>green tea</strong>,        <strong>ginger</strong>, and <strong>quercetin </strong>may help reduce
    inflammation as well.
  </li>
  <li>
     Supplemental forms of several endogenous compounds may be important for
    preventing inflammation and damage, including<strong> S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe)</strong>,    <strong>glucosamine</strong>, and <strong>chondroitin sulfate</strong>.

"<div>  <a name=""introduction""></a>  <p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a <strong><em>systemic inflammatory disease</em></strong> characterized by an <em>autoimmune response</em> that causes pain and disfigurement in peripheral joints. A dangerously underappreciated fact about RA is that it also significantly increases risk of <strong>cardiovascular disease</strong>. Because systemic inflammation hastens the onset of most age-related diseases, individuals afflicted with RA have a nearly <strong>40%</strong> increased risk of <em>dying</em> compared to healthy people (Khan 2010; Radovits 2010; Peters 2009).</p>
  <p>Too often, conventional treatment strategies yield only marginal relief and fall pitifully short of mitigating the systemic risks that threaten the longevity of RA patients. <strong>Life Extension</strong> encourages both patients and physicians to view RA as a disease of the entire body, not just the joints. Initiating an aggressive cardiovascular risk reduction program should be as high a priority as relieving joint pain. </p>
  <p>In this protocol, you will discover an advanced European drug delivery system that dramatically augments the efficacy and lessens the side effects of prednisone, a drug commonly used in the treatment of RA. You will also learn about <strong><em>oral tolerance</em></strong> – a unique, drug-free strategy that helps re-train the immune system to not attack the joints, as well as convenient blood tests and scientifically studied natural compounds that allow you to assess and target your cardiovascular risk.</p>

  <h2> What is Hypoglycemia?
  </h2>
<p>
    Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can cause significant and
    life-threatening consequences if not treated immediately. Hypoglycemia is
    often caused by overly aggressive treatment with glucose-lowering drugs in
    diabetic patients—glucose levels drop too low, causing an episode of
    hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can also be reactive; if glucose is absorbed too
    rapidly after eating, it can cause sudden spikes in insulin levels in
    people with diabetes or prediabetes, which then cause glucose levels to
    plummet.
</p>
<p>
    For patients with diabetes, proper dosing of medications is essential to
    avoid hypoglycemic episodes. Also, maintaining healthy glucose levels is a
    proactive step that is important for everyone.
</p>
<p>
Natural interventions such as fructooligosaccharides and    <em> Irvingia gabonensis </em>can help slow glucose absorption to prevent
    the sudden spikes and dips associated with hypoglycemic episodes.
</p>
<h2> What Causes Hypoglycemia?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Iatrogenic hypoglycemia: caused by diabetes medications that reduce blood
    glucose levels </li>
  <li> Reactive hypoglycemia: insulin hypersecretion after meals (common in
    people who have undergone gastric bypass) </li>
  <li> Other causes such as fluoroquinolone use, Addison’s disease, polycystic
    ovary syndrome, and advanced liver or kidney disease </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are the Signs and Symptoms of Hypoglycemia?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Shaking or tremors
  </li>
  <li>
    Pounding heart
  </li>
  <li>
    Anxiety
  </li>
  <li>
    Sweating
  </li>
  <li>
    Tingling
  </li>
  <li>
     If insufficient glucose is available in the brain, warmth, confusion, or
    drowsiness may occur.
  </li>
  <li> Prolonged hypoglycemia can lead to coma and/or death. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Note</strong>: Symptoms of hypoglycemia do not always manifest; some people may be
  unaware they are hypoglycemic until glucose levels drop dangerously low.
  Proper glucose level monitoring is essential in those with diabetes or
  prediabetes. </p>
<h2> 
        What are the Conventional Medical Treatments for Hypoglycemia?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Immediately restoring normal blood glucose levels by administering
    glucose </li>
  <li> Long-term management to prevent future episodes, such as changing
    medications or dosing </li>
</ul>
<h2> What Novel Therapies Exist for Hypoglycemia?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Implantable continuous glucose monitoring devices </li>
  <li> Improving patients’ awareness of hypoglycemia with medications such as
    naltrexone or fluoxetine </li>
  <li> Treatment with acarbose to slow the breakdown of carbohydrates into
    glucose </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
  What Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Can Help Manage Hypoglycemia?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Increase intake of dietary fiber to slow the rate of carbohydrate
    absorption </li>
  <li>
    Eat less refined carbohydrate-rich foods
  </li>
  <li> Eat several small meals and snacks throughout the day </li>
  <li>
    Do not drink alcohol without eating
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> What Natural Interventions Can Help Manage Hypoglycemia?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fructooligosaccharides</strong>. Fructooligosaccharides are prebiotic fibers found in many plant foods
    that can help stabilize post-meal glucose levels. One study
    demonstrated that supplementation with fructooligosaccharides
    significantly improved glucose profiles and reduced episodes of
    hypoglycemia. </li>
  <li><strong>Chromium</strong>. Chromium supplementation can help control blood glucose levels and
    improve the metabolism of carbohydrates. </li>
  <li><strong>Green coffee bean extract</strong>. The extract from unroasted coffee beans and a derived compound,
    chlorogenic acid, have been shown to temper post-meal glucose spikes,
    reduce glucose absorption, and inhibit the intestinal enzyme
    alpha-glucosidase. </li>
  <li><strong>White bean extract</strong>. White bean extract blocks alpha-amylase, an enzyme responsible for
    breaking down sugars. Blocking this enzyme slows the rate of glucose
    absorption. </li>
  <li><em><strong>Irvingia gabonensis</strong></em><em>. </em>
    <em>African mango tree extract (</em>
    <em>Irvingia gabonensis</em>
    <em>) also blocks alpha-amylase</em>
    . This extract may also help with weight loss.<em></em>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Seaweed extracts</strong>. Extracts from kelp and bladderwrack inhibit alpha-amylase and
    alpha-glucosidase, the enzymes that help with breaking down dietary
    starches. </li>
  <li><strong>L-arabinose</strong>. An indigestible plant compound, L-arabinose inhibits the enzymatic
    activity of sucrase, the enzyme that breaks down sucrose. L-arabinose
    can therefore prevent the spike in blood sugar that follows sugar-rich
    meals. </li>

  <h2> What is a Stroke?
  </h2>
<p>
    A stroke is the result of loss of blood flow, and subsequent oxygen, to
    part of the brain. Decreased blood flow to parts of the brain can be caused
    by blockage, often from blood clots (ischemic stroke), or by the rupture of
    a brain blood vessel and subsequent hemorrhaging (hemorrhagic stroke).
    Strokes are one of the top causes of death and disability.
</p>
<p>
    Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes are severe and life-threatening. Other
    less severe types of strokes include transient ischemic attacks (“mini
    strokes” that resolve within 24 hours) and “silent” strokes that do not
    cause overt stroke-like symptoms.
</p>
<p>
Natural interventions such as <strong>olive leaf extract </strong>and    <strong>olive oil</strong> as well as certain <strong>B-vitamins</strong>
    can help reduce the risk of a stroke.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Note: Emergency treatment within 4.5 hours of the onset of a stroke is
        essential. If you or someone you know exhibit any signs of a stroke,
        immediately call 911.

  <strong>
    Note: If you or someone you know experience stroke-like symptoms call
    911 immediately, even if you are unsure whether a stroke occurred.
    </strong>
</p>
<h2> What are the Conventional Medical Treatments for Stroke?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Emergency treatments for ischemic stroke:
  </li>
  
  <ul>
  <li>
     Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (ie, an enzyme that leads
    to clot breakdown)
  </li>
  <li>
     Aspirin and antiplatelet agents
  </li>
  <li>
     Surgery
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <li> Secondary ischemic stroke prevention may include antiplatelet therapy
    such as low-dose aspirin or anticoagulant therapy such as warfarin. For
    patients who cannot take blood thinners, a surgical procedure called left
    atrial appendage occlusion is another option. </li>
  <li>
    Emergency treatments for hemorrhagic stroke:
  </li>
  
  
  <ul>
  <li>
     Surgery to stop the bleeding and drain the blood outside blood vessels
  </li>
  <li>
     Vitamin K if the patient was taking warfarin, to counteract its effects
  </li>
  <li> Nimodipine to control vasospasm and lower blood pressure </li>
  </ul>
  
  <li> Secondary hemorrhagic stroke prevention may include medications to
    control blood pressure. </li>
</ul>
<h2> What Natural Interventions Can Help Prevent a Stroke?
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Note: </strong>
    Adhering to a Mediterranean-style diet has been associated with reduced
    all-cause mortality and lower incidence of several age-related diseases,
    including stroke.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Olive leaf and olive oil</strong>. Olive, an important constituent of the Mediterranean diet, has
    anti-hypertensive and anti-atherosclerotic effects. A study showed
    older subjects who consumed olive oil had a 41% lower risk of ischemic
    stroke than subjects who never consumed olive oil. </li>
  <li><strong>Nattokinase</strong>. Nattokinase, an enzyme extracted from fermented soybeans, can help
    reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Nattokinase reduces the
    viscosity of blood, lowering blood pressure and clot risk. </li>
  <li><strong>L-carnitine</strong>. L-carnitine, a cofactor in the metabolism of lipids, has been shown
    in preclinical studies to be neuroprotective. </li>
  <li><strong>Vinpocetine</strong>. Vinpocetine is a derivative of vincamine, an extract from periwinkle.
    It has neuroprotective and cerebral blood flow-enhancing properties, as
    well as anti-inflammatory action. </li>
  <li><strong>Vitamin D</strong>. Vitamin D deficiency is an independent risk factor for stroke in
    certain populations. A study also showed subjects with higher vitamin D
    levels had the lowest incidence of heart attack and stroke. </li>
  <li><strong>Vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid</strong>. Treatment with these B-vitamins can lower stroke risk and overall
    stroke incidence. A review found that B-vitamin supplementation reduces
    stroke risk by approximately 12%. </li>
  <li><strong>Omega-3 fatty acids</strong>. Omega-3 fatty acids have cerebrovascular protective abilities. In
    addition to clinical studies demonstrating cardioprotective abilities,
    a preclinical study found treatment with the omega-3 fatty acid
    docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) decreased mouse brain damage after an
    ischemic stroke. </li>
  <li><strong>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)</strong>. DHEA improves arterial dilation and protects against endothelial
      dysfunction. Higher levels of a DHEA metabolite have been associated with less severe
    strokes.
  </li>
  <li> Other natural interventions that may reduce the risk of stroke include<strong> garlic</strong>, <strong>vitamin C</strong>,<strong> flavonoids</strong> (eg, <strong>resveratrol</strong>), and    <strong>rutin</strong>.</li></ul></div>",https://www.lifeextension.com/Protocols/Heart-Circulatory/Stroke-Cerebrovascular-Disease/Page-01

  <h2> What is Raynaud’s Phenomenon?
  </h2>
<p>
    Raynaud’s phenomenon is a disorder in which blood vessels overreact to cold
    temperature or stress. Generally, blood vessels in fingers or toes are most
    affected. The blood vessels constrict, causing reduced blood flow to the
    affected extremity. Primary Raynaud’s phenomenon has no identified
    underlying cause and is generally not permanently damaging. Secondary
    Raynaud’s phenomenon, however, is related to an underlying cause and may be
    more damaging to the affected tissue.
</p>
<p>
    With primary Raynaud’s phenomenon, minor lifestyle changes may be enough to
    reduce symptoms. However, with secondary Raynaud’s phenomenon, medical
    treatment is likely necessary to address the underlying cause.
</p>
<p>
Natural integrative therapies such as <strong>magnesium </strong>and    <strong>N-acetylcysteine</strong> may help manage symptoms of Raynaud’s
    phenomenon.
</p>
<h2> What are the Risk Factors for Raynaud’s Phenomenon?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Excessive alcohol consumption
  </li>
  <li>
    Smoking
  </li>
  <li>
     Underlying medical conditions such as systemic sclerosis, scleroderma,
    and hypothyroidism
  </li>
  <li>
     Certain medications, including beta-blockers and some chemotherapy drugs
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are the Signs and Symptoms of Raynaud’s Phenomenon?
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
     “Triphasic” skin color change—the affected limb or digit generally turns
    white (decreased blood flow, sometimes accompanied by numbness or
    tingling), then blue (poor oxygenation), then red (blood flow is restored,
    sometimes accompanied with feeling warmth and pain).
  </li>
  <li> In severe cases of secondary Raynaud’s phenomenon, ulcers and gangrene
    may occur in the affected extremity. </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are Conventional Treatments for Raynaud’s Phenomenon?
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: Most cases of primary Raynaud’s phenomenon can be treated with moderate
    lifestyle changes. Secondary Raynaud’s phenomenon requires managing the
    underlying condition, as well as lifestyle changes.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Lifestyle changes include:
  </li>
  
  <ul>
  <li>
     Dressing warmly
  </li>
  
  <ul>
  <li>
     Keeping extremities warm (eg, gloves and socks)
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>
     Avoiding touching anything that vibrates
  </li>
  <li> Quitting smoking </li>
  <li> Avoiding caffeine </li>
  <li> Avoiding emotional stress </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <li> Medications used to treat (usually secondary) Raynaud’s phenomenon and
    associated complications: </li>
	
	
	<ul>
  <li> Calcium channel blockers (eg, nifedipine) </li>
  <li> Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil) </li>
  <li> Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, fluoxetine) </li>
  <li> Other drugs such as statins, prostacyclin, and angiotensin-converting
    enzyme inhibitors </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2> What are Emerging Therapies for Raynaud’s Phenomenon?
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Topical nitrate therapy
    </li>
    <li>
        Botulinum toxin (Botox)
    </li>
    <li>
        Endothelin receptor A inhibitors
    </li>
</ul>
<h2> 
        What Natural Interventions May Be Beneficial for Raynaud’s Phenomenon?
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Magnesium</strong>. Low magnesium levels can increase contractility in blood vessels, and
        constriction of blood vessels is an important contributor to Raynaud’s
      phenomenon. </li>
    <li>
        <strong>N-acetylcysteine</strong>. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) supports production of glutathione, which in
        turn prevents damage to blood vessel lining. Several studies indicate
      that NAC infusions reduced the severity and frequency of attacks. </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Yohimbine</strong>. Yohimbine, an indole alkaloid derived from the bark of the yohimbe
      tree, can block alpha-2 receptors involved in vasoconstriction. </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Vitamin C</strong>. Vitamin C promoted vasodilation and improved blood flow in people
        with coronary artery atherosclerosis, a condition that shares some risk
      factors with secondary Raynaud’s phenomenon. </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Essential fatty acids</strong>. Fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid
        (DHA), and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) have blood thinning effects and
      may help relieve symptoms of Raynaud’s phenomenon. </li>
    <li>
        <strong>L-arginine</strong>. The amino acid L-arginine is important for synthesizing nitric oxide,
      a vasodilator. </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Ginkgo biloba</strong>. Ginkgo biloba extract may decrease vasoconstriction. A study showed
        that treatment with the extract reduced the number of attacks of
      Raynaud’s phenomenon. </li>
    <li>
Other natural interventions such as <strong>vitamin D</strong>,<strong>vitamin E</strong>,<strong>niacin and inositol hexanicotinate</strong>, and        <strong>selenium</strong> may help to improve the symptoms of Raynaud’s
        phenomenon.

  <h2> What are the Potential Benefits of Caloric Restriction?
  </h2>
<p>
    Caloric restriction (CR), the significant decrease in calorie intake, is a
    strategy for improving health and increasing lifespan. Increased lifespan
    has been observed in many types of calorie-restricted animals, including
    rhesus monkeys. Significantly, restricting calories does not only lengthen
    lifespan, but also <em>healthspan</em> (the period of healthy living before
    the onset of age-related diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular
    disease, and some cancers).
</p>
<p>
    Lifespan studies in humans are difficult; however, CR studies in humans can
    measure biomarkers of aging (eg, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEA-S],
    the levels of which decrease with age).
</p>
<p>
    CR in humans has been shown to improve heart function, reduce markers of
    inflammation, and reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease and
    diabetes.
</p>
<p>
    CR has been shown to increase risk of diminishing muscle strength, aerobic
    capacity, and bone mineral density; therefore, proper exercise in addition
    to a CR diet is crucial. Never attempt a drastic change in diet or exercise
    regimen without consulting a doctor.
</p>

<h2> What are Caloric Restriction Mimetics?
</h2>

<p>
    Maintaining a long-term CR diet can be very difficult and demanding.
    Therefore, calorie restriction mimetics (CRMs), or compounds that mimic the
    effects of CR, are desirable. CRMs mimic the metabolic, hormonal, or
    physiological effects of CR without reducing long-term food intake, while
    stimulating maintenance and repair processes, and producing CR-like effects
    on longevity and reduction of age-related disease.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tetrahydrocurcumin </strong>
    and <strong>green tea polyphenols </strong>have both demonstrated
    increases in average and maximum lifespan in mice.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Ginkgo biloba </strong>
    significantly increased the lifespan of male Fischer rats.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Rapamycin</strong>
    and <strong>aspirin</strong> were both identified as having CR mimetic
    activity in rodents.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Resveratrol</strong>
    has anti-inflammatory activity, as well as CR-mimicking activity, in
    several species.
  </li>
  <li>
    It has been suggested that several <strong>plant-derived polyphenols</strong>, including        <strong>quercetin</strong>, exerted health benefits via CR-like
    modulations of stress-response pathways.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Nicotinamide riboside</strong>
    is a source of vitamin B3 and a precursor for nicotinamide adenine
    dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>). Nicotinamide riboside supplementation
    had CR-like positive effects on health in yeast and mice.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Metformin</strong>, generally used as a diabetes drug, extended the lifespan of mice and
    decreased the incidence of certain tumors. Metformin can also activate
    adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that
    affects glucose metabolism and fat storage. </li>
  <li><em><strong>Gynostemma pentaphyllum</strong></em>
    <strong> (<em>G. pentaphyllum</em>)</strong>
    can also activate AMPK. <em>G. pentaphyllum</em> supplementation in
    humans has been shown to exert effects seen in CR, such as improved
    glucose metabolism and reduced body weight.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Hesperidin</strong>, a plant flavonoid, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, 
    insulin-sensitizing, and lipid-lowering activity. Evidence suggests
    hesperidin may help prevent and treat several age-related chronic diseases.    <em></em>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)</strong>
    increased mitochondrial DNA content and stimulated oxygen respiration
    (both indicative of biogenesis) in mouse hepatoma cells.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Fish oil</strong>, while not a CRM, appeared to work synergistically with CR to reduce
    oxidative damage. </li>

  <p> Cirrhosis is the pathological replacement of functional liver tissue with scarred, fibrous, nonfunctional tissue (Bohm 2010). Most forms of late-stage
    chronic liver disease often manifest cirrhosis (Liou 2014). </p>
  <p> Cirrhosis can progress for years before the patient experiences any symptoms (Liou 2014). In this phase, which is called ""compensated cirrhosis,"" enough
    healthy liver tissue remains to carry out the important functions of the liver (UMMC 2013; BLT 2011). As the disease progresses to the point where there is
    not enough functional liver tissue remaining to support metabolic demands, ""decompensated cirrhosis"" emerges. A cirrhotic patient is deemed ""decompensated""
    upon the emergence of symptoms such as ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), variceal bleeding (hemorrhage of dilated blood vessels,
    usually in the esophagus or stomach), hepatic encephalopathy (altered mental state due to the diseased liver's inability to remove toxins from the blood),
    or jaundice (yellowing of the whites of the eyes and skin) (MedicineNet 2014; Garcia-Tsao 2012). </p>
  <p> Worldwide, cirrhosis prevalence is increasing in tandem with rising incidence of its primary risk factors: hepatitis virus infection, alcoholism, and
    non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Sirli 2012; Schuppan 2013). As of 2014, cirrhosis was the 12<sup>th</sup> most common cause of death in the
    United States (National Center for Health Statistics 2013; Fox 2014; Garcia-Tsao 2012). </p>
  <p> Owing to its myriad and diverse responsibilities within the body, functional liver loss leads to repercussions in several areas, including digestion,
    detoxification, circulation, energy production, and immune function, which can ultimately lead to the potentially life-threatening complications seen in
    decompensated cirrhosis: cardiovascular and pulmonary compromise; kidney failure; serious infection; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; and neurological,
    endocrine, and skeletal disorders (Liou 2014; Schuppan 2008). </p>
  <p> Currently, the only definitive cure for cirrhosis is liver transplant (Manns 2013). However, awareness of modifiable risks such as alcohol consumption and
    obesity may help prevent the disease; early detection and treatment of underlying conditions may help slow its progression; and dietary and lifestyle
    changes may further improve quality of life in patients with cirrhosis (Liou 2014; Schwartz 2012; Plauth 2006; Amodio 2013; Purnak 2013). </p>
  <p> This protocol will discuss the nature, causes, and outcomes of cirrhosis; outline current and emerging methods of diagnosis and treatment; and summarize
    state of the art nutritional support for the cirrhotic patient. </p>
</div>",https://www.lifeextension.com/Protocols/Gastrointestinal/Cirrhosis/Page-02
"<div><a name=""background"" id=""background""></a>

  <p> The liver has a vast array of metabolic responsibilities; as the largest organ of the digestive system, it (Marieb 2010): </p>
  <ul>
    <li>secretes bile to emulsify and absorb dietary fats (Nicolaou 2012)</li>
    <li>receives fatty acids and lipoproteins from circulation and repackages them for distribution throughout the body (McGillicuddy 2011)</li>
    <li>stores the bulk of excess glucose as glycogen to fuel the nervous system during periods of starvation</li>
    <li>processes most excess amino acids into glucose and detoxifies their byproduct (ammonia) into urea to be removed from the body (Kaloyianni 1990; Jungas
      1992)</li>
    <li> stores vitamins (B<sub>12</sub>, A, D, K) and minerals (iron, copper) (Loew 1999; Higashi, Sato, 2005; Shearer 1996; Anderson 2005; Roberts 2008) </li>
    <li>synthesizes albumin, the principal protein of the blood and a factor responsible for maintaining blood volume for proper circulation and oxygen transfer
      to peripheral tissues (Busher 1990) </li>
    <li>synthesizes most of the clotting factors, which are necessary for proper hemostasis during vascular damage (Mammen 1992) </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The liver also functions as a biological filter, detoxifying foreign molecules and endogenous metabolites. The liver receives blood from the intestines
    (via the portal vein) and from the systemic circulation (through the common hepatic artery). The liver consists of several types of cells; of these, <em>hepatocytes </em>occupy almost 80% of the total liver volume and participate in most functions of the liver (Kmiec 2001). These extremely metabolically
    active cells are responsible for most of the liver’s detoxification, synthetic, and storage activities. Blood and its contents that have been filtered and
    metabolized by the hepatocytes exit the liver through the hepatic vein and enter the systemic circulation. Waste (excess hormones, foreign toxins,
    metabolites from dead cells) is excreted from the liver through its bile canaliculi and ducts, and along with bile, is stored in the gallbladder then
    poured into the intestines for ultimate excretion. In this way, the liver acts to constantly surveil the contents of circulating blood, and clear it of
    waste and toxins, while also providing a first-pass filtration of ingested foodstuffs from the intestines before they enter the general circulation (Marieb
    2010). </p>
  <p> Given its diversity of functions, it becomes apparent how stress on the liver (such as from excessive detoxification demanded during chronic alcoholism,
    infection by hepatitis viruses, or during storage of excessive amounts of fat) has the potential to affect several major processes simultaneously (eg,
    circulation, clotting, digestion, energy production, detoxification, waste elimination) and presents a serious health threat (Marieb 2010). </p>

"<div><a name=""complications"" id=""complications""></a>
  
  <p> Cirrhosis can be the end stage of any chronic liver disease (Garcia-Tsao 2009). It begins with chronic inflammation, triggering the wound healing process
    and initiating tissue destruction and its replacement with new fibrous tissue. As the chronic disease persists, low level “wound healing“ and deposition of
    fibrous tissue continues, eventually building scar tissue with decreasing probability of being reversed and remodeled into functional tissue (Schuppan
    2013). </p>
  <p> Cirrhosis can be classified as <strong>compensated</strong> or <strong>decompensated</strong>. Compensated (where liver function is maintained) cirrhosis can remain asymptomatic for many
    years. Decompensated (marked by deteriorating liver function) cirrhosis is characterized by the development of a serious complication; once a complication
    of cirrhosis develops, the 5-year survival rate decreases to less than 20% (Liou 2014; Schuppan 2013; Garcia-Tsao 2009; D'Amico 2006). </p>
  <p> There are many possible complications of cirrhosis: </p>
  <p> <strong>Portal hypertension</strong> (high blood pressure in the liver). During cirrhosis, deposition of fibrous tissue increases resistance to the flow of blood through
    the portal vein of the liver; this increases portal blood pressure and causes portal hypertension. To alleviate the excessive pressure, new collateral
    blood vessels are generated, which bypass the liver and deliver intestinal blood to the other organs. Portal hypertension leads to dramatic changes in
    circulation, with detrimental consequences for kidney, lung, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular function (Iwakiri 2014; Busk 2013; Biecker 2013; Aprile
    2002). Portal hypertension is the cause of a majority of complications associated with cirrhosis (Tsochatzis 2014; Procopet 2013). </p>
  <p> <strong>Ascites.</strong> Ascites is the the most common complication of cirrhosis; 50% of patients will develop ascites within 10 years (Liou 2014). Ascites is associated
    with a 50% increased risk of mortality over two years (Moore 2006). Ascites, an increase in free fluid in the abdomen, is due to increased pressure of
    hepatic circulation that forces blood plasma (the clear, fluid portion of the blood) out of blood vessels and into the body cavity (Chung 2013; Gatta 2012;
    Moore 2006). </p>
  <p> <strong>Bacterial peritonitis.</strong> Infection of the ascitic fluid in the abdominal cavity occurs in about 30% of patients with cirrhosis and ascites; it has an
    in-hospital mortality rate of about 20% (Liou 2014; A.D.A.M. 2014). Decompensated liver cirrhosis delays intestinal motility and increases intestinal
    permeability, both of which facilitate the translocation of harmful bacteria out of the intestines (Bruns 2014). </p>
  <p> <strong>Coagulopathy.</strong> The majority of protein factors responsible for blood clotting, as well as those that prevent clotting, are synthesized in the liver. In
    patients with severe liver disease, the ability to synthesize these factors is reduced, and clotting disorders (coagulopathies) are possible. These often
    manifest as increased bleeding (hemorrhagic coagulopathies), although increased clotting (thrombosis) is also possible. The liver also manufactures protein
    factors that stimulate blood platelet production, and cirrhotic patients can have low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) that further increase bleeding
    risk. Additionally, liver disease can result in malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamin K, a cofactor for the activity of multiple enzymes in the clotting
    cascade. A variety of tests can be used to monitor changes in clotting in patients with cirrhosis-related coagulopathies (see Life Extension’s <a href=""/protocols/heart_circulatory/blood_clot_01.htm"" title=""Blood Clot Prevention"" style=""color:rgb(0, 114, 187)"">Blood Clot Prevention</a> protocol for detailed descriptions of these tests).
    Severe bleeding episodes are treated by a number of methods, including vitamin K injection, plasma or platelet transfusion, blood protein transfusion
    (cryoprecipitate), or clot-forming drugs; thromboses and embolisms are treated with injectable anticoagulants (Amarapurkar 2011). </p>
  <p> <strong>Gastroesophageal varices.</strong> Esophageal varices are abnormal, enlarged veins in the lower part of the esophagus. Gastric varices are enlarged veins in the
    stomach. Both result from portal hypertension (Garcia-Tsao 2007). Rupture and hemorrhage is a major complication of varices, with a 15-20% risk of
    mortality from each bleeding episode (Albillos 2014). Varices are present in 30-40% of patients with compensated cirrhosis and about 60% of patients with
    decompensated cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis (Liou 2014; Henry 2014). </p>
  <p> <strong>Hepatocellular carcinoma.</strong> As of 2013, hepatocellular carcinoma was the fifth most common cancer in men and the seventh in women worldwide (Kmiec 2001). The
    chronic inflammatory environment of cirrhosis plays an essential role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (Ding 2014; Berasain 2009).</p>
  <p> <strong>Hepatopulmonary syndrome.</strong> Hepatopulmonary syndrome, a serious complication of liver cirrhosis, is present in 10-17% of patients with liver cirrhosis and is    associated with a poor prognosis (Nusrat 2014). In hepatopulmonary syndrome, portal hypertension causes bacteria to cross from the intestines into the
    bloodstream. The body responds by secreting a vast number of different cellular messengers, which cause blood vessels, particularly those of the lungs, to
    dilate, which then causes inadequate blood oxygenation. Thus, a symptom of hepatopulmonary syndrome is dyspnea, or breathing difficulty (Tumgor 2014). </p>
  <p> <strong>Hepatic encephalopathy.</strong> A failing or cirrhotic liver is not able to effectively metabolize ammonia into urea, which results in a buildup of this toxin in
    the blood and in the brain, causing hepatic encephalopathy (Siegel 2006; Garcia-Tsao 2012; Rivera-Mancia 2012; Krieger 1995). Patients can exhibit various
    neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms: confusion, sleep disruption, cognitive and intellectual dysfunction, impaired motor activity, slowed or slurred
    speech, and incoordination. Coma and even death are possible in severe cases.</p>
  <p><strong>Hepatorenal syndrome.</strong> Approximately 20% of hospitalized cirrhosis patients with ascites will develop kidney dysfunction (Liou 2014). Hepatorenal syndrome
    is a functional renal failure that develops as less blood is available to circulate to the kidneys (Angeli 2012). This is a result of alterations in
    systemic circulation that accompany portal hypertension. Hepatorenal syndrome is almost always accompanied by ascites and can lead to rapid (type I
    hepatorenal syndrome) or slowly progressing (type II hepatorenal syndrome) kidney failure (Lata 2012). Signs and symptoms can be non-specific and may
    parallel those of liver disease (nausea, weight gain, dark urine), although low blood pressure, increased heart rate, low blood sodium, and sustained
    increases of nitrogenous compounds such as creatinine and urea in the blood (azotemia) are warning signs for the disease (Ng 2007; A.D.A.M. 2012; Lata
    2012). </p>
  <p> <strong>Immune dysfunction.</strong> Cirrhosis is associated with various levels of immune dysfunction, referred to as cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction syndrome.
    Cirrhosis reduces production of immune-signaling molecules in the liver, depresses activity and abundance of innate immune cells, and increases production
    of antibacterial antibodies that may also have autoimmune activity (Sipeki 2014). </p>
  <p> <strong>Malnutrition and hepatic cachexia.</strong> Malnutrition in cirrhotic patients is characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle and lean body mass (sarcopenia),
    adipose (fat) tissue (adipopenia), or both (hepatic cachexia), and does not respond to adequate dietary intake of fats or protein. Malnutrition, especially
    protein malnutrition, is associated with an increased incidence of several major complications of cirrhosis (including sepsis, ascites, and hepatic
    encephalopathy), increased mortality, and reduced quality of life (Periyalwar 2012). Malnutrition in cirrhosis patients may also include micronutrient
    deficiencies (Periyalwar 2012); cirrhotic patients are often deficient in water-soluble vitamins (especially thiamine) and minerals (Amodio 2013), and
    those with cholestatic liver disease (a disease that affects bile flow) may have difficulty absorbing fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) (Purnak 2013;
    Jaurigue 2014). </p>
  <p> Other complications of cirrhosis include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hepatic hydrothorax.</strong> Hepatic hydrothorax is a relatively uncommon complication (5-10% of patients with cirrhosis and ascites) in which fluid accumulates
      in the compartment around the lungs, potentially leading to breathing difficulties (Liou 2014; Norvell 2014).</li>
    <li><strong>Endocrine disorders.</strong> Testicular atrophy and <strong>low testosterone levels</strong> are frequent in men with cirrhosis, and this can be associated with signs of
      feminization and gynecomastia. The liver and adrenal glands have a complex interrelationship, and <strong>adrenal insufficiency</strong> is common in patients with stable
      and decompensated cirrhosis (Burra 2013; Trifan 2013).</li>
    <li><strong>Hepatic osteodystrophy.</strong> A metabolic bone disease that can occur in patients with chronic liver disease, hepatic osteodystrophy can result in osteoporosis
      (loss of bone density and mass) and/or osteomalacia (softening of bones). </li>
  </ul>

"<div><a name=""causes"" id=""causes""></a>

  <p> Almost any chronic liver disease can develop into cirrhosis. One of the most common causes of cirrhosis globally is chronic viral hepatitis, with 30%
    attributed to <strong>chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection</strong> and 27% to <strong>chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection</strong> (Nishioka 2002; Dwyre 2011). Risk factors for
    infection include intravenous drug use, unprotected intercourse, blood transfusions, and tattoos (Perz 2006).<strong> Alcoholic liver disease</strong> is the second major
    worldwide contributor to cirrhosis incidence, accounting for almost one-third of cases (NIDDK 2014a). <strong>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</strong> (NAFLD) and its
    more severe form, <strong>nonalcoholic steatohepatitis</strong> (NASH), are common causes of cirrhosis in the United States and are highly associated with obesity and
    metabolic syndrome (Armstrong 2014). NASH currently affects 2-5% of Americans; NAFLD is present in an additional 10-20% in the United States (NIDDK 2014c;
    Ferri 2014). NASH is now the third most common cause of cirrhosis after viral hepatitis and alcoholic liver disease (NIDDK 2014a). </p>
  <p> Of these, hepatitis C deserves special attention because it is often asymptomatic and may not be detected until cirrhosis is already present, which can be
    many years after the virus is contracted (NIDDK 2012b). It is a common infection in the United States, affecting over 3 million people. The most common
    cause of transmission today is the use of shared drug injection needles or equipment. Before 1992, when the blood supply was not tested for it, hepatitis C
    was transmitted through blood transfusions and organ transplants. Maternal-fetal transmission is also possible (CDC 2014). Hepatitis C viral infection is
    detectable with blood tests (NIDDK 2012b), and hepatitis C can be treated before it progresses to cirrhosis (Keating 2014; FDA 2013). </p>
  <p> Aside from these top causes, there are several other less common chronic liver diseases that can lead to cirrhosis (Baertling 2013; Welty 2014; Haafiz
    2010; Liou 2014; Moyer 2009; NIDDK 2012a; Fairbanks 2008): </p>
  <p> <strong>Autoimmune hepatitis:</strong> an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the body’s own hepatocytes </p>
  <p> <strong>Cholestatic liver diseases</strong> (diseases that interfere with the production or flow of bile), such as: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Primary biliary cirrhosis:</strong> a chronic and slowly progressive inflammatory liver disease that is thought to be autoimmune in origin and results from damage
      to the small bile ducts</li>
    <li><strong>Primary sclerosing cholangitis:</strong> a condition often associated with inflammatory bowel disease that results in inflammation and fibrosis, which causes
      narrowing and dilation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts </li>
    <li><strong>Cystic fibrosis:</strong> an inherited condition characterized by thick secretions that mainly affect the lungs, pancreas, intestines, and liver </li>
    <li> <strong>Biliary atresia:</strong> congenital malformation of bile ducts </li>
  </ul>
  <p> <strong>Inherited metabolic disorders</strong>, such as: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency:</strong> a genetic disease that can cause chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma </li>
    <li> <strong>Wilson’s disease:</strong> an inherited copper storage disease </li>
    <li><strong>Hereditary hemochromatosis:</strong> iron storage disease</li>
    <li><strong>Glycogen storage diseases:</strong> excessive liver storage of glycogen</li>
    <li><strong>Abetalipoproteinemia:</strong> inability to synthesize certain lipoproteins and to absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Budd-Chiari syndrome:</strong> thrombosis (clotting) of liver blood vessels </p>
  <table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" class=""protSidebar""><tbody><tr><td><h3><strong> Decrease the Risk of Cirrhosis by Treating Chronic Liver Disease</strong></h3>

<p>
    Proper management and treatment of existing liver disease and compensated cirrhosis improves outcomes and may lead to regression of fibrosis in some cases.
    Salient examples include hepatitis C, in which early diagnosis and innovative treatment may result in a cure, thus preventing cirrhosis entirely (Keating
    2014); immunosuppressive treatment of autoimmune hepatitis (Shah 2011; Valera 2011); and cessation of alcohol consumption in alcoholic liver disease
    (Nusrat 2014).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Alcoholic liver disease.</strong>
    Abstain from alcohol and reduce other risk factors (obesity, smoking) (European Association for the Study of Liver 2012). Psychotherapies promoting
    abstinence can be beneficial, as can pharmacotherapies that treat alcohol dependence (disulfiram [Antabuse], naltrexone [Revia], acamprosate [Campral], and
    baclofen [Kemstro] (Jaurigue 2014).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Hepatitis B.</strong> Vaccination of high-risk individuals against HBV is a standard public health measure (WHO 2009). Hepatitis B is treated with interferon drugs
    and nucleoside analogs. Interferon treatments have a relatively high rate of side effects (Papatheodoridis 2002; Scaglione 2012). </p>
<p>
    <strong>Hepatitis </strong><strong>C.</strong> Pegylated interferon combined with ribavirin has been the standard treatment for hepatitis C for many years, and it results in complete virus
    clearance in some cases. The exact treatment regimen varies depending on the HCV genotype, whether there has been previous unsuccessful treatment, and
    whether the patient is eligible for interferon. As is the case with hepatitis B, interferon treatment is often accompanied by severe side effects (Craxi
    2003; Pawlotsky 2004; Hofmann 2008; Scaglione 2012). In 2013, two new drug treatments were approved for hepatitis C: sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) and simeprevir
    (Olysio). Both have been greeted as important advances in the treatment of hepatitis C (Keating 2014; FDA 2013). The cost and pricing of the new drugs have
    been subject to some controversy (Degasperi 2014; Senior 2014). </p>
<p>
    <strong>Hemochromatosis.</strong> Phlebotomy (blood removal), iron chelators (deferoxamine mesylate, deferiprone [Ferriprox], deferasirox [Exjade]) (Heli 2011; Crownover
    2013; Fabio 2007; Gattermann 2009) </p>
<p>
    <strong>Primary biliary cirrh</strong><strong>osis.</strong> Ursodeoxycholic acid, a prescription form of isolated and concentrated bile acid, is the only approved treatment at the time of
    this writing. However, obeticholic acid, a semi-synthetic bile acid analogue, has been granted the FDA’s fast-track designation, which helps expedite
    development of new drugs (Lindor 2009; Intercept Pharmaceuticals 2014). </p>
<p>
    <strong>Wilson’s disease.</strong> Copper chelators (D-penicillamine [D-Penamine], triethylenetetramine, zinc salts) (Delangle 2012) </p>
<p>
    <strong>Budd</strong><strong>-Chiari syndrome.</strong> Anticoagulants (low molecular weight heparin, vitamin K antagonists), beta-blockers, balloon angioplasty/stents (Plessier 2012) </p>
<p>
    <strong>Autoimmune hepa</strong><strong>titis.</strong> Immunosuppressants or immune modulators: prednisone, azathioprine (Imuran), budesonide (Enweluzo 2013; Delgado 2013; Czaja 2012; Wolf

  <h2> Clinical Signs and Symptoms </h2>
  <p> Clinical signs and symptoms of cirrhosis include (NIDDK 2014a; A.D.A.M. 2013): </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fatigue/weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, abdominal pain, and pruritus (itching)</strong>, which are common
      symptoms of cirrhosis, although not specific to cirrhosis</li>
    <li><strong>Splenomegaly</strong>, a palpably enlarged spleen, which can sometimes be felt on physical exam</li>
    <li> <strong>Spider angioma</strong> (spider veins) are occasionally seen </li>
  </ul>
  <p> The consequences (sequelae) of cirrhosis can also result in distinctive associated symptoms in individuals with advanced disease (Park 2013; NIDDK 2014a;
    Elwell 2003; Cavanaugh 1990; Yurci, Yucesoy 2011; Stillman 1990; Nayak 2012). </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Abdominal distention</strong> due to the abdomen filling with ascitic fluid</li>
    <li><strong>Jaundice (Icterus)</strong>, a yellowing of the skin and sclera (whites of eyes) can be seen in advanced stages of cirrhosis. This is due to the buildup of <em>bilirubin</em>, a yellow waste pigment from the normal breakdown of old red blood cells that is usually removed from the blood by the liver</li>
    <li><strong>Bruising or excessive bleeding</strong> from loss of coagulation (clotting) protein production</li>
    <li><strong>Melena</strong>, or dark stools resulting from digested blood in feces, and <strong>“coffee ground” emesis</strong>, which is vomiting of digested blood, may
      result from a combination of coagulopathy and disordered gastrointestinal hemodynamics proceeding from portal hypertension</li>
    <li><strong>Pale or clay-colored stools</strong> that result from lack of bile secretion</li>
    <li><strong>Altered mental state</strong>, including confusion, personality change, slowed or slurred speech, memory loss, trouble concentrating, and changes in sleep habits
      can result from hepatic encephalopathy</li>
    <li><strong>Asterixis</strong> (flapping tremors), intermittent involuntary muscle contractions, usually of the wrists and hips, can also be caused by hepatic encephalopathy</li>
    <li><strong>Lower extremity swelling/peripheral edema</strong> due to low albumin in the blood leading to abnormal fluid collection in tissues</li>
    <li><strong>Recurrent infections</strong> due to immune dysfunction</li>
    <li> <strong>Dyspnea</strong> (difficulty breathing) from hepatopulmonary syndrome </li>
    <li><strong>Hypogonadism</strong>, a syndrome of low testosterone and libido, impotence, and shrinkage of the testes, may also cause gynecomastia (male breast enlargement)</li>
    <li><strong>Bone loss or fracture</strong> from metabolic bone disease</li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Testing </h2>
  <p> Several tests, both non-invasive and invasive, can aid in confirming a diagnosis of cirrhosis (Kim 2014). </p>
  <p> <strong>Biochemical tests.</strong> Multiple markers of liver function can be measured from blood samples. Alanine transaminase (<strong>ALT or SGPT</strong>) and aspartate transaminase
    (<strong>AST or SGOT</strong>) are released by damaged or inflamed hepatocytes; gamma-glutamyl transferase (<strong>GGT</strong>) and <strong>bilirubin</strong> are indicators of cholestasis (failure of the
    liver to excrete bile). All four can become elevated during liver disease. Patients with cirrhosis also show increased alkaline phosphatase (<strong>ALP</strong>) activity.
    Several compounds synthesized by a healthy liver (<strong>haptoglobin, apolipoprotein-A1, albumin, alpha-2-macroglobulin</strong>) may fall with the onset of liver damage.
    Panels that test several markers concurrently (eg, Fibrotest, APRI, or the European Liver Fibrosis Panel) are widely validated and are good predictors of
    fibrosis and cirrhosis, but are insufficient for evaluating dynamic changes (Kim 2014; Ohkubo 1994). </p>
  <p> <strong>Diagnostic imaging.</strong> <strong>Ultrasound (US)</strong> is an inexpensive, non-invasive imaging modality that constructs dynamic 2D images using high-frequency sound waves. It
    can be used to assess several liver parameters (eg, size, bluntness of edges, coarseness of liver tissue, presence of surface nodules) that may be
    consistent with hepatic fibrosis. <strong>Doppler ultrasound</strong> can additionally measure velocity of blood flow in the liver, and may detect changes in portal vein
    volume and velocity and arterial resistance in the liver, which may be evident in portal hypertension. <strong>Contrast-enhanced ultrasound</strong> is a more recent
    technique that involves the injection of “microbubbles” intravenously prior to imaging, which enhances the ultrasound signals and allows for more detailed
    measurements of blood flow. <strong>Computed tomography (CT)</strong> is a three-dimensional x-ray imaging technique for visualizing internal structures; <strong>magnetic resonance
    imaging (MRI)</strong> is an imaging technique that produces cross-sectional images using radio waves in powerful magnetic fields. Both are useful methods for
    visualizing advanced liver disease and are standard methods for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis patients. Both are suitable for imaging
    the anatomical features of advanced cirrhosis (surface nodules, prominent fibrous bands, shrinkage of liver volume, and an enlarged portal venous system),
    but are not as useful for diagnosing early stages of cirrhosis where these features may be absent (Kim 2014). </p>
  <p><strong>Elastography.</strong> Elastography is a newer ultrasound-based method that measures liver stiffness as a marker for fibrosis, enabling diagnosis of liver fibrosis
    in earlier stages before obvious changes in liver architecture like surface nodules may be present (Adebajo 2012; Sirli 2012). Two newer technologies, <strong>transient elastography</strong> and <strong>acoustic radiation force impulse elastography</strong>, utilize different ultrasonic strategies to obtain stiffness
    measurements; both have similar sensitivity and specificity for the diagnoses of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (Bota 2013; Sirli 2012).</p>
  <p> <strong>Liver biopsy.</strong> Biopsy remains the gold standard for assessing liver fibrosis. It allows direct examination of inflammatory and architectural changes due to
    fibrosis, and allows staging of the liver disease, which may guide treatment. Biopsies are not without limitations, however, as they are invasive and have
    potential for complications. Because the biopsied sample is representative of only a very small fraction of liver tissue, biopsies are subject to sampling
    error (Kim 2014). Three biopsy approaches are used. <strong>Percutaneous biopsies</strong> use a hollow cutting needle inserted through skin and into the liver to take one
    or more samples. <strong>Laparoscopic biopsy</strong> is a minimally invasive surgical technique used to obtain samples from a specific area of the liver
    or to avoid disrupting a tumor or site of infection (NIDDK 2014b). </p>
  <p> For patients with ascites or a clotting disorder, a <strong>transjug</strong><strong>ular biopsy</strong> may be taken; here the biopsy needle is threaded down the neck through the jugular
    vein into the liver, and samples are taken under x-ray guidance. Transjugular biopsy allows measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient, which is a
    good predictor of portal hypertension and thus of clinical prognosis. Because it is an accurate prognostic test but invasive and not widely available,
    attempts have been made to use ultrasound measurements of liver stiffness (such as elastography) as a proxy to estimate hepatic venous pressure gradient
    (Tsochatzis 2014). </p>
  <p> <strong>Other diagnostic techniques.</strong> Other techniques may also be used in liver disease or related pathology: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Upper GI endoscopy.</strong> Direct visualization of dilated or ruptured blood vessels in the esophagus or stomach by a flexible camera (endoscope) is the gold
      standard for identifying varices, a common, serious complication of portal hypertension and cirrhosis (Berzigotti 2013). </li>
    <li><strong>Autoantibody testing.</strong> Anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA) is found in the blood of 90-95% of patients with <strong>primary biliary cirrhosis</strong>, a condition that
      creates a chronic obstruction of bile ducts, which can lead to cirrhosis (Tanaka 2002). </li>
    <li><strong>Molecular analysis.</strong> Genomic analysis is available for inherited disorders of metabolism that increase cirrhosis risk. These include tests for <strong>Wilson’s
      disease</strong> (copper storage disease); <strong>HFE gene mutations</strong>, the most common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis (iron overload); <strong>alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency</strong>;
      and <strong>cystic fibrosis</strong> (Santos 2012; Zarrilli 2013). </li>
    <li><strong>Ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) testing.</strong> Both of these iron transport proteins are elevated in individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, a
      risk factor for cirrhosis (Zarrilli 2013). </li>
  </ul>
  <p> <strong>Prognostic Scores</strong></p>
  <p> Prognostic scoring combines laboratory and qualitative measurements of liver function to estimate the survival of a cirrhosis patient within a given time
    period (Durand 2008). Two systems are in use. An older system, the <strong>Child-Pugh (or Child-Turcotte-Pugh) score</strong> considers <em>albumin</em> and <em>bilirubin</em> levels,
    clotting (<em>international normalized ratio; INR</em>) time, and the degree of <em>ascites</em> and <em>encephalopathy</em> in its scoring system. The Child-Pugh score
    ranges from 5-15, with the lowest scores of 5-6 (class A) indicating a better rate of survival after one year (81%) than the highest scores of 10-15 (class
    C), which indicate a one-year survival rate of 45% (Huo 2006; Fox 2014). Child-Pugh has largely been replaced by the <strong>Model for End-Stage Liver Disease
    (MELD)</strong> score, as MELD is a more accurate predictor of survival (Lee 2013). It is derived from an equation that accounts for the biomarkers <em>cre</em><em>atinine</em>, <em>bilirubi</em><em>n</em>, and prothrombin time (<em>international normalized ratio; INR</em>). It is used to predict short-term (3-month) survival in patients with liver disease.
    MELD scores range from 6 to 40 on a continuous scale, with higher scores indicating greater risk of mortality within a three-month period (a MELD score of
    40 indicates a 71.3% risk of mortality, while a score &lt;9 indicates a 1.9% risk) (Wiesner 2003; Fox 2014). The MELD system is used in the United States
    for ranking patients for liver transplants (Durand 2005). Other permutations of the MELD score are also in use, including MELD-Na (which incorporates blood
    sodium levels into the MELD equation to prioritize patients with low blood sodium for transplants), MELDNa (which further refines MELD-Na), and DeltaMELD
    (which monitors MELD changes over time and is useful in predicting intermediate outcomes in patients with advanced cirrhosis) (Lee 2013). </p>

"<div> <a name=""conventional"" id=""conventional""></a>
  
  <p> The first goal of cirrhosis management is preventing progression of the underlying chronic liver disease to reduce risk of decompensated cirrhosis. Once a
    decompensation event occurs, the focus becomes treatment of cirrhosis complications and the option of liver transplantation. The definitive treatment for
    decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplant (Ferri 2014). </p>
  <p> Management of cirrhosis complications includes (Liou 2014): </p>
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Ascites.</strong> Therapy for ascites includes treatment of the underlying disorder (eg, cessation of alcohol use, treatment of hepatitis), sodium restriction
      (≤2g/day), and diuretics (“water pills;” a combination of <em>spironolactone</em> and <em>furosemide</em> has been recommended) (Liou 2014; Garcia-Tsao 2012). Patients with
      refractory ascites may require additional treatment with <em>large volume paracentesis</em>, the direct removal of ascitic fluid from the abdomen through a
      catheter. Correction of albumin deficiency can improve circulatory function following paracentesis, and albumin administration (6 – 8 g/L of ascitic fluid
      removed) is recommended when the volume of ascites fluid removed by paracentesis exceeds 5 liters (Bernardi 2012; Garcia-Tsao 2012). Paracentesis fluid can
      also function as a diagnostic technique for bacterial infection (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) in hospitalized cirrhotic patients and may improve
      short-term survival (Orman 2014). <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Portal hypertension.</strong> Options for the conservative management of portal hypertension are limited. Beta-blockers and nitrates may sometimes be recommended,
      along with diuretics in cases of ascites. However, surgical treatment involving the installation of shunts can be performed for serious cases (NIDDK 2014a;
      Anand 2012). <br>
      <br>
Portal hypertension, and refractory cases of ascites, can be treated surgically with placement of a<em> transj</em><em></em><em></em><em>ugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt </em>(TIPS).
      This method is less invasive than traditional surgery. In TIPS placement, artificial channels are installed that directly connect the flow of the portal
      vein and hepatic veins. <br>
      <br>
In a 2014 meta-analysis of trials in which TIPS was compared to paracentesis in 390 patients, TIPS significantly reduced the need for liver transplants
      (39%); the incidence of recurrent ascites (85%) and hepatorenal syndrome (68%); and reduced deaths from liver disease (38%). However, in this study
      population, TIPS more than doubled the risk of severe hepatoencephalopathy and nearly tripled the risk of hepatoencephalopathy overall (Bai 2014). <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.</strong> Treatment with broad-spectrum oral or intravenous antibiotics (Liou 2014). <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Hepatorenal syndrome.</strong> Therapy includes vasoconstrictors (eg, octreotide [Sandostatin] or terlipressin [Glypressin]) and albumin (to increase circulation
      and oxygenation of the kidneys) (Arroyo 2014; Garcia-Tsao 2012).<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Hepatic hydrothorax.</strong> Typical treatment includes dietary sodium restriction and diuretics (Liou 2014). <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Esophageal and gastrointestinal varices.</strong> Screening by endoscopy is recommended to check for varices. Non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol [Inderal],
      nadolol [Corgard]) do not prevent varices, but may reduce the risk of rupture and hemorrhage of fragile varices (Liou 2014). Endoscopic ligation of varices
      may also be effective. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Hepatic encephalopathy.</strong> Hepatic encephalopathy can be treated with non-absorbable carbohydrates (lactulose), which are fermented by colonic bacteria and
      help to reduce excess ammonia. Rifaximin (Xifaxan), a non-absorbable antibiotic, is effective against ammonia-producing bacteria and appears to be as
      effective as lactulose in the treatment of symptoms related to mild-to-moderate encephalopathy (Zullo 2012; Kimer 2014). <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Hepatocellular carcinoma.</strong> Surgical excision of hepatocellular carcinoma is indicated when the tumor is a more important clinical concern than cirrhosis.
      Often only part of the tumor can be removed (Graf 2014). Even then, hepatocellular carcinoma recurs within 5 years more than 50% of the time (Liou 2014). <em>Ablation</em> (local destruction of the tumor) is an option in patients who are not suitable for resection. Common treatment techniques include ethanol
      injection and radiofrequency ablation (Graf 2014). <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Hepatic o</strong><strong></strong><strong>s</strong><strong>teodystrophy.</strong> Calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K may be used for osteopenia; alendronate (Fosomax) is often prescribed for osteoporosis.
      Calcitonin has also been studied for this purpose (Lipkin 2002; Liou 2014; Yurci, Kalkan 2011; Goel 2010). </li>
  </ul>
  <p> <strong>Transplantation.</strong> Liver transplantation surgery has become the standard treatment for end-stage cirrhosis and chronic liver disease over the past two
    decades, resulting in a marked reduction in deaths from chronic liver disease (Fox 2014; Silva Santos 2012). Liver transplantation survival rates in the
    United States are now greater than 74% after 5 years post-surgery (Liou 2014). There are several medical contraindications to liver transplantation:
    cardiac and pulmonary diseases, sepsis or active infection, cancer outside the liver, poorly-controlled HIV infection, insufficient social support or
    psychiatric disorders that would prevent post-transplant medical compliance, and active substance abuse. Advanced age, obesity, HIV infection,
    malnutrition, and a history of poor medication compliance are relative contraindications to liver transplant surgery (Fox 2014). Although transplantation
    can be curative for cirrhosis (and a number of chronic liver diseases), it typically requires a lifetime of immunosuppressive drug therapy to prevent
    “rejection” of the transplanted organ by the immune system. </p>

      <tr>
        <td><h3><strong> Liver Transplantation in the United States</strong></h3>
          <p> Liver transplantation, once viewed as an experimental procedure, is now the only treatment for end-stage liver disease, liver cancer, and cirrhosis that
            has a substantial impact on patient survival (Sanyal 2010; Wong 2002; Schuppan 2008). Almost 57 000 adult liver transplant recipients are currently alive
            in the United States, a number that has doubled in the last 10 years (SRTR 2012). </p>
          <p> With the acceptance of transplantation as routine care, the demand for donor organs has increased significantly, far outpacing their availability. Metrics
            like the MELD score have aided in prioritizing patients for transplants in a way that addresses the most serious cases first, but many patients still die
            while waiting for a donor organ. According to the most recent Organ Procurement and Transportation Network Report, 6256 adults received liver transplants
            in 2012, with 15 308 candidates on the waiting list for a liver. While the number of new transplant candidates added to the list each year has begun to
            decrease, the rate of transplants has also been decreasing, and median wait times for a transplant have increased to over 18 months. The rate of
            pre-transplant death has also increased for the first time in several years (SRTR 2012). </p></td>

"<div> <a name=""therapies"" id=""therapies""></a>
  
  <p> Emerging therapies for cirrhosis mostly target the pathways that initiate hepatic fibrosis (Rockey 2013). </p>
  <p> <strong>PPAR Activators</strong> </p>
  <p> PPAR-γ is a <em>nuclear receptor</em> that is predominantly found in liver and adipose tissue. It becomes active when it senses fatty acids (and some anti-diabetic
    drugs) within cells, and responds in turn by activating genes that regulate lipid metabolism and fat cell growth (Zhang, Kong 2013). While it is a target
    for medications that restore insulin sensitivity in diabetics and promote fatty acid metabolism in high cholesterol, PPAR-γ also plays an important role in
    liver repair. During liver damage, specialized storage cells in the liver called hepatic stellate cells become active, multiplying and producing large
    amounts of fibrous matrix, which is a central event in hepatic fibrogenesis and cirrhosis. PPAR-γ inhibits this fibrosis, making it an attractive target
    for anti-fibrotic therapies (Zhang, Kong 2013; Deng 2012). Thiazolidinediones, originally developed as anti-diabetic drugs, activate PPAR-γ and have shown
    mixed results for hepatic fibrosis in animal investigations and early clinical trials; multiple larger trials of several candidates (pioglitazone [Actos],
    Rosiglitazone [Avandia], GFT505) for use in the treatment of fibrosis from NASH are underway or have recently been completed (Schuppan 2013). </p>
  <p> <strong>Ursodeoxycho</strong><strong style=""line-height:1.428571429"">lic Acid</strong></p>
  <p> Ursodeoxych<span style=""line-height:1.428571429"">olic acid (UDCA; Ursodiol), a natural constituent of bile, is the only approved pharmacological treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis, a
    disease that can cause liver cirrhosis (Corpechot 2000; Intercept Pharmaceuticals 2014). However, UDCA has broader pharmaceutical applications that are
    rarely appreciated or even understood. It is a promising therapy that deserves, and is indeed the subject of, further trials for chronic liver disease.</span></p>
  <p> In a long-term (1-2 year) placebo-controlled trial evaluating UDCA (with or without vitamin E) in patients with NASH, those who received UDCA and vitamin E
    experienced a statistically significant reduction in the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as well as
    significant improvements in liver tissue structure including steatosis, cellular injury, and inflammation (Dufour 2006). A two-week, double-blind,
    crossover study compared UDCA to placebo for 10 cirrhotic patients with indigestion and excess fat in their stools. During the trial, both groups ate an
    identical controlled diet. The treatment reduced indigestion symptoms common in cirrhosis; lowered the amount of fat in the stool, a sign of improved fat
    digestion; and significantly reduced AST levels in the blood (Salvioli 1990). Another uncontrolled trial using UDCA significantly lowered ALT in cirrhotic
    patients during a 15-month trial (Buongiorno 1994). In an uncontrolled trial that followed 100 patients over more than five years, UDCA was used as a
    hepatic anti-inflammatory in an attempt to prevent progression from early hepatitis C-associated cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma. Subjects not taking
    UDCA had two and a half times the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma as did those taking placebo (Tarao 2005<span style=""line-height:1.428571429"">).</span></p>
  <p> <strong>Pento</strong><strong style=""line-height:1.428571429"">xifylline</strong></p>
  <p> By inhibiting the pro-inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), pentoxifylline may attenuate liver inflammation, one of the initiators of
    liver fibrosis (Jaurigue 2014). In an animal model of cirrhosis, it prevented the development of hepatopulmonary syndrome; it also decreased the risk of
    hepatorenal syndrome in cirrhosis patients in several studies (Sztrymf 2004; Parker 2013). A systematic review of pentoxifylline trials has shown
    conflicting data on survival of patients with chronic liver diseases (Jaurigue 2014). Pentoxifylline has also shown mixed results on reducing liver
    fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C infection or NASH, with several trials underway or recently completed (Schuppan 2013). </p>
  <p> Current evidence points to pentoxifylline as an effective therapy to reduce the risk of severe hepatorenal syndrome in alcoholic hepatitis, but without
    apparent improvement in overall survival. It is recommended by several major gastroenterology organizations as a second-line therapy for severe alcoholic
    hepatitis for those in whom corticosteroids are contraindicated (Jaurigue 2014). </p>
  <p> <strong>Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers </strong></p>
  <p> The <em>renin-angiotensin system</em>, which is central to the regulation of blood volume and pressure, has long been a therapeutic target for the treatment of
    hypertension and congestive heart failure (Li 2004; Volpe 2002). It may also represent a target for novel anti-fibrotic drugs. During chronic liver injury,
    overproduction of the hypertensive hormone <em>angiotensin II</em> can stimulate the activation of hepatic stellate cells and their overproduction of fibrous tissue
    in the liver (Kim 2012). Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may block this interaction. Several ARBs (losartan [Cozaar], telmisartan [Micardis],
    olmesartan [Benicar], candesartan [Atacand], and valsartan [Diovan]) have been shown to reduce fibrosis in multiple animal studies and human trials of NASH
    and NAFLD (Georgescu 2008). A trial of a combination of candesartan and UDCA (a prescription isolated and concentrated bile acid) versus UDCA alone reduced
    measures of fibrosis in subjects with compensated alcoholic liver fibrosis (Kim 2012). Of the several available ARBs, telmisartan appears most intriguing
    because in addition to having demonstrated beneficial effects in various animal cirrhosis or fibrosis models (Tamaki 2013; Mende 2013; Jin 2007), it also
    activates an important modulator of metabolic activity called PPAR-gamma (Benson 2004). The PPAR-gamma signaling pathway is important for optimal
    mitochondrial function and the formation of new mitochondria, and this pathway appears to be downregulated among people with insulin resistance compared to
    healthy individuals (Patti 2003; Din 2014). Moreover, PPAR-gamma and associated metabolic pathways are thought to mediate some of the beneficial effects of
    caloric restriction and help promote cellular stress resistance and longevity; thus, agents that activate PPAR-gamma, like telmisartan, have gained the
    attention of longevity researchers as potential anti-aging interventions (Corton 2005; Scalera 2008). </p>
  <p> As a word of caution, it is worth noting that the combination of an ARB with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor caused severe hepatic
    encephalopathy in a patient with cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and kidney disease in one case study, which reversed when the combination was discontinued
    (Oertelt-Prigione 2010). </p>
  <p> <strong>Lysyl Oxidase Inhibitors</strong> </p>
  <p> Lysyl oxidase is an enzyme responsible for cross-linking collagen fibrils, one of the final steps in the maturation of the fibrous matrix produced during
    liver fibrosis. Additionally, lysyl oxidase is also thought to inhibit the breakdown of fibrous matrix, preventing the reversal of fibrosis. A humanized
    antibody (simtuzumab) against LOXL2 (one of the lysyl oxidase enzymes) is the subject of two trials for liver fibrosis at the time of this writing
    (Schuppan 2013). </p>
  <p> <strong>Stem-Cell Therapy </strong></p>
  <p> Liver transplant remains the only definitive cure for end-stage, fibrotic liver disease. Given the shortage of donor livers, stem cell therapy may prove a
    useful alternative for replenishing hepatocytes, reducing inflammation, and reversing liver fibrosis in patients with cirrhosis or liver failure. Several
    human trials have investigated the use of mesenchymal (connective tissue), bone marrow-derived, or hematopoietic (blood-derived) stem cells in patients
    with liver failure or cirrhosis, and have revealed improvements in liver function, liver volume, and MELD or Child-Pugh score (Zhang, Wang 2013); several
    more trials are underway (Schuppan 2013). </p>
  <p> <strong>Liver Dialysis </strong></p>
  <p> Liver dialysis has similarities to kidney dialysis; aiming to filter blood through an external device to provide short-term support to the liver
    (<em>extracorporeal liver support therapy</em>) (Stange 2011). Since many blood toxins are tightly bound to albumin molecules in circulation, liver dialysis devices
    must selectively separate these toxins from the albumin, while preserving albumin levels in the blood. The use of this therapy is more prevalent outside
    the United States, though multiple reviews have reached varying conclusions about its degree of improvement to mortality and avoidance of liver transplant.
    Its primary indication is as a “bridge to transplant” – a palliative treatment that can be used while waiting for a liver transplant (Nevens 2012; Zheng
    2013; Krisper 2011). Several different methodologies are in use: molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS); Prometheus dialysis; plasma exchange
    combined with hemodialysis (PE/HD); and single-pass albumin dialysis (SPAD) (Schaefer 2013). </p>

        <td><h3><strong> Metformin Continuation in Diabetics with Cirrhosis</strong></h3>
          <p> The prevalence of diabetes in patients with cirrhosis – reported at 37% – is five times higher than in those without cirrhosis. Moreover, cirrhotic
            patients who have diabetes are at increased risk of liver-related complications and death compared to those without diabetes (Zhang 2014). </p>
          <p> Metformin, one of the most widely prescribed anti-diabetic drugs worldwide (Chen 2013), has been associated with reduced risk of several forms of cancer,
            including liver cancer, in diabetics (Thakkar 2013; Zhang, Li 2013). Since patients with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma,
            these findings raise the intriguing possibility that use of metformin in cirrhosis patients who have diabetes may provide protection against liver cancer
            in this at-risk population. On the other hand, the impact of liver impairment on the metabolism of metformin has not been extensively investigated, and
            some clinicians discontinue metformin in diabetics upon diagnosis of cirrhosis, citing concerns over increased risk of lactic acidosis (Scheen 2014; Zhang
            2014). However, a 2014 study suggests that the benefits of metformin use in diabetics with cirrhosis may outweigh the risks (Zhang 2014). </p>
          <p> Researchers analyzed data on 250 diabetics diagnosed with cirrhosis between 2000 and 2010. One hundred seventy-two of these subjects continued taking
            metformin after being diagnosed with cirrhosis, while 78 discontinued the drug. The median survival time for those who continued metformin was 11.8 years,
            whereas those who stopped using metformin survived for a median of 5.6 years. The study authors noted that “<em>Continuation of metformin after cirrhosis diagnosis reduced the risk of death by 57%.</em>” Importantly, they also highlighted the fact that “<em>No patients developed metformin-associated lactic acidosis during follow-up.</em>” Based upon their findings, the researchers concluded that “ <em>Metformin should therefore be continued in diabetic patients with cirrhosis if there is no specific contraindication</em>” (Zhang 2014). </p></td>

<p>
  <strong>Abstain From Alcohol </strong></p>
<p>
    Alcoholism is the second most common cause of cirrhosis in the United States (NIDDK 2014a; Orman 2013; Perz 2006). Five-year survival amongst all cirrhotic
    patients is 70%, but is only 30% in drinkers with decompensated cirrhosis. In contrast, prognosis improves with abstinence; after alcohol cessation, the
    5-year survival of patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis can climb as high as 90% and 60%, respectively (Schwartz 2012).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Avoid Tobacco Use </strong></p>
<p>
    In one population-based study, smoking &gt;10 g tobacco/day nearly quadrupled the risk of alcoholic cirrhosis and more than doubled the risk of other types
    of cirrhosis in women. In men, the corresponding increases were 60% and 40%, though the latter results fell just shy of statistical significance. Tobacco
    smoke contains chemical substances with cytotoxic properties that can activate stellate cells and induce fibrosis. In addition, smoking increases
    pro-inflammatory chemical messengers (eg, TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6) and decreases anti-inflammatory messengers (eg, IL-10) (Dam, Flensborg-Madsen 2013).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Adjust Prescription Drug Doses </strong></p>
<p>
    Many drugs depend on the liver for metabolism, or require albumin, synthesized by the liver, for their pharmacokinetics and distribution. Cirrhosis alters
    these processes, making reduced dosages, or in some cases, avoidance, necessary. Recommendations for safe prescribing include (Lewis 2013):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduce medication dosages</strong> in general (consult your healthcare professional before making a change) </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Opioid analgesics, anxiolytics, and sedatives</strong> can cause or worsen hepatic encephalopathy symptoms and should be used cautiously </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</strong> can more readily cause renal failure and gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and should
    generally be avoided </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Anticancer and immunomodulating drugs</strong>; lower doses are recommended for some agents </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Antimicrobials</strong>; some types (macrolides, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides) should generally be avoided </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Proton pump inhibitors and histamine blockers</strong> can lead to serious infections </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Antidepressants</strong>; half-lives and clearances may be altered </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cardiovascular drugs</strong>; dose adjustments may be needed for anti-arrhythmic drugs and beta-blockers </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Coffee</strong> </p>
<p>
    Coffee consumption has been associated with a lower incidence of cirrhosis in several observational studies (Muriel 2010). In one study, 4 or more cups of
    coffee per day reduced the risk of alcoholic cirrhosis by 80% compared to non-coffee drinkers. For one to three cups, the associated protection was 40%.
    The same study found that for non-alcoholic cirrhosis, 4 or more cups per day conferred a 30% reduced risk of cirrhosis (Klatsky 2006). Coffee may reduce
    the risk of fibrosis by lowering blood levels of growth factors associated with liver damage and fibrosis (Arauz 2013). Coffee consumption has also been
    associated with reduced risk of liver cancer in several European and Japanese studies, especially among heavy drinkers (consumption of over 3 cups of
    coffee per day reduced hepatocellular carcinoma risk by an average of 55% over 12 observational studies) (Bravi 2007; Larsson 2007).
</p>
<p>
    Some benefit of coffee may be due to its antioxidant content (Arauz 2013). There is no definitive indication of exactly which coffee compounds are
    responsible for its health benefits. However, chlorogenic acids (a member of the group of antioxidant compounds known as polyphenols) have been shown in
    animal models to reduce liver inflammation and fibrosis (Shi 2009; Shi 2013).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Maintain Adequate Nutrient Intake </strong></p>
<p>
    Liver disease in general, and cirrhosis especially, increases the likelihood of malnutrition, which is not surprising given the vital role of the liver in
    maintaining nutrient levels and energy balance (Purnak 2013). The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN), the International Society
    for Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism Consensus, and other groups have developed recommendations for avoiding malnutrition in individuals with
    cirrhosis or hepatic encephalopathy (Plauth 2006; Amodio 2013; Purnak 2013):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Calories</strong>. Patients should strive for an energy intake of 35-40 kcal/kg/day (Plauth 2006; Amodio 2013). Moderate, gradual weight loss is indicated for
    many individuals with NAFLD or NASH. Dietary fructose has been associated with metabolic syndrome and diabetes, two conditions associated with NAFLD and
    NASH (Purnak 2013). </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Protein</strong>. Restriction of dietary protein is not recommended, unless it is not tolerated due to hepatic encephalopathy. The diet should include 1.2-1.5
    g/kg/day of whole protein to avoid muscle wasting (Plauth 2006). </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Vitamins</strong>. Patients with both alcohol and non-alcohol-related cirrhosis may be deficient in water-soluble vitamins, especially <strong>thiamine</strong>, and
    supplementation is warranted in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Amodio 2013). <strong>Vitami</strong><strong>n B<sub>12</sub></strong> and <strong>folate</strong> deficiencies have
    been reported in HBV and HCV infection (Purnak 2013); folate deficiency was present in one study of obese patients with NAFLD (Hirsch 2005). Low folate
    concentrations were associated with elevated levels of the vasculotoxic compound homocysteine in cirrhosis patients in an observational study (Kazimierska
    2003). Patients with cholestatic liver disease may have reduced absorption of <strong>fat-soluble vitamins</strong> (<strong>A, D, E, and K</strong>) (Purnak 2013; Jaurigue 2014). Vitamin A
    deficiency is also a common problem in HCV infection (Purnak 2013), and vitamin K may be useful in the treatment of bone loss in patients with cirrhosis
    and chronic liver disease (Shiomi 2002; Lipkin 2002). </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Minerals</strong>. Tissue zinc levels are decreased in patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy, though trials of zinc supplementation have had
    conflicting results (Amodio 2013). Hepatic osteodystrophy, a common consequence of cirrhosis, can lead to <strong>calcium/magnesium</strong> imbalances. One study found
    that untreated hepatitis C patients presented with lower levels of plasma and red blood cell zinc and selenium than did healthy control subjects (Ko 2005). </li>

<p>
  <strong>Nutrients for Viral Hepatitis </strong></p>
<p>
    Viral hepatitis (B and C) is the leading risk factor for the development of cirrhosis and liver failure. Several nutrients have been studied in human
    trials for their effects on minimizing risks or improving outcomes of hepatitis B viral infection, either alone or as adjuncts to antiviral drugs. These
    include <strong>green tea extract</strong>, <strong>selenium</strong>, <strong>coffee/chlorogenic acid</strong>, <strong>zinc</strong>, <em><strong>phyllanthus</strong></em>, <strong>whey protein</strong>, <em><strong>astragalus</strong></em>, <em><strong>schizandra</strong></em>, and <strong>milk thistle</strong>. These are reviewed
    in Life Extension’s <a href=""/protocols/infections/hepatitis_b_01.htm""><em>Hepatitis B protocol</em></a>. The nutrients <strong>S-adenosylmethionine
    (SAMe)</strong>, <strong>N-acetyl cysteine (NAC)</strong>, <strong>alpha lipoic acid</strong>, <strong>whey protein</strong>, <strong>milk thistle</strong>, <strong>licorice</strong>, <em><strong>schizandra</strong></em>, <strong>vitamin D</strong>, <strong>coffee</strong>, <strong>zinc</strong>, <strong>curcumin</strong>, and <strong>L-carnitine</strong> have each been investigated in human trials as potential adjuncts to hepatitis C treatments. See Life Extension’s <a href=""/protocols/infections/hepatitis_c_01.htm""><em>Hepatitis C protocol</em></a> for more details on these studies.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Nutrients for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis </strong></p>
<p>
    In the United States and developing world, NAFLD and NASH together are the third most common cause of cirrhosis. <strong>Vitamin E</strong>, <strong>omega-3 fatty acids</strong>, and
  <strong>N-acetyl cysteine plus metformin</strong> have each been studied as possible adjuncts to treatment of NAFLD and NASH in human trials. </p>
<p>
Further nutritional strategies are reviewed in Life Extension’s    <em><a href=""/protocols/gastrointestinal/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease_01.htm"">Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) protocol</a>.
</em></p>
<p>
  <strong>Nutrients for Iron Overload </strong></p>
<p>
    High iron stores are a risk factor for the development of liver disease (Fargion 2011; Valenti 2012), and patients with hereditary hemochromatosis are at
    increased risk for cirrhosis (Crownover 2013). Nutrients that have been investigated in human clinical trials for their ability to reduce iron load include
      <strong>pectin</strong>, <strong>milk thistle</strong>, and <strong>green tea</strong> (reviewed in Life Extension’s <a href=""/protocols/metabolic_health/hemochromatosis_01.htm""><em>Hemochromatosis protocol</em></a>).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Nutrients specifically investigated in the context of cirrhosis or its complications include:</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Milk Thistle/Silymarin </strong></p>
<p>
    Milk thistle and its principal flavonoid mixture silymarin have shown remarkable hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects against several types of liver
    damage (including chemical, viral, inflammatory, and poisoning) in laboratory, rodent, and human settings (Vargas-Mendoza 2014; Polyak 2013; Jia 2001).
    They have been investigated for a number of chronic liver conditions that can precede cirrhosis, including viral hepatitis (Hawke 2010), alcoholic liver
    disease (Habib-ur-Rehman 2009; Ferenci 1989), and NAFLD (Loguercio 2012). Studies in cirrhotic patients have shown mixed results. In a study of patients
    with alcoholic and non-alcoholic cirrhosis, 4-year survival rates were higher in patients on silymarin (140 mg, three times daily) compared to control
    subjects (58% vs. 39%, respectively) (Ferenci 1989). A similar study, however, failed to show any survival benefit at 6 years in patients taking 450 mg
    silymarin per day. It is important to note that all the patients in this second study had alcoholic cirrhosis, and many significantly reduced their alcohol
    intake over the course of the study, possibly obscuring any effects of silymarin (Parés 1998). In patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, silymarin reduced
    markers of oxidative damage and improved antioxidant status (Lucena 2002).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Branched-Chain Amino Acids </strong></p>
<p>
    Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), nutritionally essential amino acids not metabolized into energy in the liver, are
    taken up by skeletal muscle where they serve multiple purposes. The breakdown products of BCAAs can be used to form the amino acid glutamate, which can
    scavenge toxic ammonia in skeletal muscles and convert it into glutamine (Dam, Ott 2013; Amodio 2013). A systematic review of 8 trials (382 cirrhosis
    patients) on the use of BCAAs for symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy demonstrated a clear benefit in reducing manifestations of the disease in patients
    with both minimal and overt forms of encephalopathy (Gluud 2013). The effect was independent of the cause of cirrhosis (alcoholic or viral), and the
    average dose was 0.25g/kg/day. Other authors believe that the effect of BCAAs is entirely a result of their leucine content, and that while BCAAs may
    eventually be proven to have nutritional benefits for cirrhosis patients, including regeneration of liver cells, they are not effective for hepatic
    encephalopathy (Amodio 2013).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Vitamin D</strong>
</p>

<p>
    About 66% of patients with moderately severe cirrhosis, and 96% of people waiting for liver transplants, have vitamin D deficiency. In individuals with
    chronic liver disease, the rate of osteoporotic fractures is approximately twice that of age-matched controls. For these reasons, calcium and vitamin D
    supplementation have been recommended for patients with cirrhosis and low bone density (Crawford 2006). In a study of over 324 subjects with alcoholic
    liver disease compared to controls, severe vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with higher liver enzymes, increased hepatic venous pressure
    gradient, and worse MELD and Child-Pugh scores. Further analysis showed that low vitamin D was associated with cirrhosis and mortality after one year
    (Trepo 2013). An analysis of chronic liver disease patients admitted to an outpatient liver clinic found that vitamin D deficiency predicted worse
    Child-Pugh and MELD scores, and may predict decompensation and mortality in chronic liver failure patients (Putz-Bankuti 2012). A study on 88 hospitalized
    patients in the hepatology unit of a hospital revealed that low levels of vitamin D were independently associated with bacterial infection in patients with
    cirrhosis; another similar study found that low vitamin D was associated with increased mortality in patients with severe liver disease (Anty 2014; Stokes
    2013). A laboratory study using a special form of vitamin D along with a novel chemotherapeutic agent inhibited proliferation of hepatic stellate cells
    (Neeman 2014).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Vitamin C </strong></p>
<p>
    Patients with cirrhosis show endothelial dysfunction within the vessels of the liver, and this is associated with lower circulating levels of vitamin C. In
    an uncontrolled study of cirrhosis patients, intravenous injection of 3 g vitamin C lowered markers of oxidative stress and venous pressure within the
    liver (Hernández-Guerra 2006). Vitamin C mitigated the increase in liver fat and globulins (blood proteins) caused by experimentally induced cholestasis
    (decreased bile flow) in rats (Matos 2008) and reduced alcohol-induced small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth in a model of alcoholic liver fibrosis in
    guinea pigs (Abhilash 2014).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Vitamin E</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Liver cirrhosis patients generally have low blood levels of vitamin E; liver biopsies from people with alcoholic cirrhosis typically show lower hepatic
    alpha-tocopherol content than individuals with normal livers, and lower blood alpha-tocopherol levels than individuals with alcoholic fatty liver or those
    with normal liver histology (Bell 1992; Lu 2003). These lower levels of vitamin E were associated with an increased susceptibility of the plasma component
    of blood to oxidative stress (Ferre 2002; Lu 2003). In patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, one author concluded that vitamin E supplementation should
    be considered not only in individuals with overt vitamin E deficiency, but also in individuals who meet certain additional criteria, such as total serum
    bilirubin over 3 mg/dL, serum cholylglycine (a crystalline bile acid involved in emulsification of fat) over 600 mcg/dL, or serum alkaline phosphatase over
    1000 IU/L (Sokol 1989). In a study that enrolled women with primary biliary cirrhosis, serum vitamin E levels were significantly decreased in patients who
    had psychomotor impairment (Arria 1990).
</p>
<p>
    Patients with liver cirrhosis show marked increases in oxidative stress levels. In patients with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis, vitamin E normalized levels
    of the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT), while vitamin E and fermented papaya extract each improved glutathione levels, which were significantly
    lower in patients with cirrhosis (Marotta 2007). A study on patients with liver cirrhosis and a history of hepatitis C infection revealed that participants
    treated with alpha-tocopherol lived longer without the development of hepatocellular carcinoma as compared to participants who were not treated, but the
    difference was not statistically significant (Takagi 2003). A study on 80 prospective liver transplantation recipients showed that oral tocotrienols
    lowered MELD scores by 50%, whereas supplementation with 200 mg alpha-tocopherol lowered it by only 20%. The authors concluded that further studies are
    needed to examine the effects of tocotrienols in end-stage liver disease (Patel 2012).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Probiotics </strong></p>
<p>
    The wrong kind of intestinal bacteria play a role in several complications of cirrhosis; urease-producing bacteria in the gut increase ammonia production,
    which contributes to hepatic encephalopathy, and migration of bacteria across the intestinal wall has been implicated in both spontaneous bacterial
    peritonitis and bleeding due to esophageal varices (Pereg 2011). Use of probiotics to address these complications has had mixed results. In some studies,
    supplementation of cirrhosis patients with probiotic bacteria (including species of <em>Lactobacilli</em>,<em> Bifidobacteria</em>, <em>Pediococcus</em>,
    and <em>Leuconostoc</em>) combined with fermentable fiber prebiotics reduced blood ammonia levels and urease-producing colonic bacteria (Malaguarnera 2010;
    Liu 2004). Two studies that used a slightly different combination of probiotics without prebiotics found no effect (Saji 2011; Pereg 2011). There was a
    trend toward reduced Child-Pugh scores (suggesting an improvement in liver function) in some studies (Lata 2007; Liu 2004), mixed results on portal venous
    pressure (Gupta 2013; Tandon 2009), and no reduction in the incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (Pande 2012).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Prebiotics</strong> </p>
<p>
    Hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of cirrhosis, is currently treated by the nondigestible, fermentable disaccharide <em>lactulose</em>, a synthetic prebiotic
    (Wang 2013; Amodio 2013). Combinations of fermentable natural fibers (beta-glucan, inulin, pectin, and resistant starch) (Liu 2004) or
    fructooligosaccharides (Malaguarnera 2010) with probiotic bacteria showed reductions in blood ammonia levels in cirrhosis patients with minimal or mild
  hepatic encephalopathy. </p>
<p>
  <strong>Zinc</strong> </p>
<p>
    In a meta-analysis of 4 randomized controlled trials of oral zinc supplementation (zinc acetate, sulfate, or carnosate) in 223 patients with hepatic
    encephalopathy resulting from cirrhosis, three trials showed improvements in cognitive function compared to baseline measurements (Chavez-Tapia 2013). In
    the fourth study using zinc carnosate, cirrhosis patients experienced reductions in blood ammonia levels, improved quality of life scores, and reduced
    Child-Pugh scores (measurements of cirrhosis severity) after six months of supplementation.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>S-Adenosylmethionine </strong></p>
<p>
    S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) participates in the synthesis of the important liver-protectant antioxidant glutathione, which is lower in patients with
    cirrhosis (Bianchi 1997; Mato 1999). Although SAMe has been studied as an innovative therapy for fibrosis (Czaja 2014), one systematic review of the
    literature was unable to confirm a statistically significant benefit in alcoholic liver disease, perhaps partially as a result of variable quality across
    studies (Rambaldi 2006). In a large clinical trial of SAMe (Mato 1999), patients with alcoholic cirrhosis on SAMe (1.2 g/day for 2 years) demonstrated a
    non-significant trend towards improvement in 2-year survival compared to control patients. When only patients with mild-to-moderate disease were included
    in the analysis, however, survival was significantly improved, and progression to liver transplantation was significantly reduced in the SAMe group (88%)
    versus the control group (71%). Differences in survival between the groups only became apparent after 1 year. Many of the subjects in this trial had
    hepatitis B or C infection in addition to alcoholic cirrhosis. While several other smaller studies have shown encouraging results for the use of SAMe to
    improve liver biochemical parameters (such as liver enzyme values) in alcoholic cirrhosis patients, they have shown mixed results for its ability to
    improve survival in patients with the disease and have had no apparent effect on steatosis, fibrosis, or inflammation (Rambaldi 2006; Medici 2011; Le
    2013).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Polyenylphosphatidylcholine (PPC)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Soybeans contain a lipid mixture called polyenylphosphatidylcholine (PPC) that has been shown to help protect the integrity of cellular membranes,
    especially in the liver. One of the mechanisms by which toxicants like alcohol lead to liver dysfunction is by damaging liver cell membranes in a process
    called lipid peroxidation. PPC helps prevent lipid peroxidation in liver cells. The lipid mixture prevented cirrhosis in animal experiments, and it opposed
    fibrosis and improved liver function tests among heavy-drinking human clinical trial participants (Lieber 2004; Lieber 2003).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Curcumin</strong> </p>
<p>
    In animal models, curcumin has mitigated liver injury from hepatitis B and C infection, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, hepatocellular carcinoma, primary
    biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; all chronic liver diseases with cirrhosis as their potential endpoint (Nabavi 2013). It may also
    have a protective effect against chemically-induced cirrhosis in animal livers (Ali 2014). In these models, curcumin inhibits metabolic pathways (such as
    NF-κB signaling) that produce the inflammatory cytokines that stimulate fibrosis (Nabavi 2013). In addition, laboratory and animal studies have shown that
    curcumin reduces β-catenin, a protein that promotes liver stellate cell activation and fibrosis (Cui 2014).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Glycyrrhizic Acid </strong></p>
<p>
    Glycyrrhizic acid, also known as glycyrrhizin, is an extract from the roots of the licorice plant <em>Glycyrrhiza glabra</em>. It has been studied and
    found effective in many conditions (Li 2014), but its most common application is in liver disease, where it has pronounced anti-inflammatory (Ming 2013)
    and anti-viral (Pu 2013) effects.
</p>
<p>
    A trial compared intravenous (IV) glycyrrhizic acid in 17 patients to IV glycyrrhizic acid plus corticosteroids in 14 patients for the treatment of
    autoimmune hepatitis. Recovery rate was significantly higher in the glycyrrhizic acid alone group (Yasui 2011). A trial in 379 patients who failed
    interferon plus ribavirin treatment for hepatitis C found that a twelve-week course of IV glycyrrhizic acid, compared to placebo, dramatically lowered the
    liver enzyme ALT. A subsequent 40-week uncontrolled trial of IV glycyrrhizic acid found a trend towards reduction of inflammation and fibrosis that barely
    missed the cutoff for statistical significance (Manns 2012). An uncontrolled study of long-term (average 10 years) oral glycyrrhizic acid administration in
    hepatitis C found that those in the treatment group had 2.5 times less chance of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, a common outcome of hepatitis C
    (Arase 1997). In a rodent model, glycyrrhizic acid was found to have hepatoprotective effects similar to silymarin (Rasool 2014).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> (CoQ<sub>10</sub>) acts as a scavenger of free radicals in cell membranes. One study found that CoQ<sub>10</sub> levels were 70%
    lower in subjects with liver cirrhosis compared to healthy controls; the authors speculated that this may be a result of low dietary intake of this
    important nutrient, or due to decreased synthesis in the cells (Bianchi 1994). Reduced CoQ<sub>10</sub> levels are also seen in patients with NAFLD
    (Yesilova 2005). CoQ<sub>10</sub> (10 or 30 mg/kg) inhibited fibrosis induced by the liver toxin dimethylnitrosamine in mice (Choi 2009).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Berberine</strong> </p>
<p>
    Berberine is a plant alkaloid that has been studied primarily for its bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties (Sun 1988). In patients with hepatic
    encephalopathy, oral berberine (600-800 mg/day) reduced blood concentrations of tyramine, an indirect neurotransmitter that is elevated in hepatic
    encephalopathy and can lead to some of its cardiovascular and neurological complications (Watanabe 1982). In a small trial of patients with chronic
    hepatitis B, C, or cirrhosis, berberine (1 g/day for 3 months) reduced circulating LDL and total cholesterol levels and liver enzymes (Zhao 2008).
</p>
<p>Although berberine  has been studied in human clinical trials and shown to have several metabolic  benefits, concerns about long-term use of berberine have been raised on the  basis of certain preclinical studies (Kysenius 2014; Mikes 1985; Mikes 1983).  Some evidence suggests that long-term berberine use, especially at high doses,  may impair particular aspects of cellular metabolism in specific types of  cells. The implications of this preclinical research are yet to be determined  by long-term human clinical trials, therefore Life Extension currently  recommends short-term use of berberine.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Green Tea Extract/Epigallocatechin-3-gallate </strong>
</p>

    Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the most potent and abundant catechin in green tea extract, usually comprising approximately 40% of green tea’s
    polyphenol content. The anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-fibrotic properties of EGCG make it a candidate as a natural therapy for hepatitis and
    liver fibrosis (Halegoua-De Marzio 2012). In a laboratory study, EGCG inhibited entry of the HCV into liver cells (Ciesek 2011). An experiment with hepatic
    stellate cells, which are key in the development of liver fibrosis, revealed that EGCG can regulate the growth and structure of these cells, such that EGCG
    may turn out to be a therapeutic agent for liver fibrosis (Higashi, Kohjima 2005). In a rat model of NASH, which is characterized by liver inflammation and
    fibrosis, and is associated with liver cancer, oral administration of EGCG (0.1% in tap water) was shown to prevent liver fibrosis and tumorigenesis (Kochi
    2014). In a mouse model of chemically-induced liver injury and fibrosis, EGCG was able to attenuate the progression of liver fibrosis, possibly as a result
    of its ability to reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory response (Tipoe 2010).
